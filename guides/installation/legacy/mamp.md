# MAMP

::: danger
This approach is no longer recomended. It is kept here as a reference.
:::

## Overview

For quick and easy installation, you can also use **MAMP** on Mac.

## Prerequisites

As a first step, make sure you installed MAMP beforehand. You can download MAMP on [this site](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).

## Preparation

### Configure PHP settings

First, you have to modify the PHP settings inside MAMP, as seen in the following screenshot:

![PHP settings](../../../.gitbook/assets/10-mac-os-x-php.png)

Next, start the mysql webserver-service with the toggle buttons on the left side in the MAMP management console.

### Prepare MySQL user and database

- Open the **MySQL Tab** on the left side and click on the *PhpMyAdmin* icon. In case the icon is grayed out, check if the mysql and webserver services are running.

![Mysql settings](../../../.gitbook/assets/10-mac-os-x-mysql.png)

- Inside PhpMyAdmin, switch to the user account management on the top menu and click *add new user*.

- Choose a username \(e.g., shopware\) and a password and set the option *Create database with same name and grant all privileges*. Set the option *Check all* in the **Global privileges** card. Also, all checkboxes in this card should be checked.

- Finish this step by clicking *GO*.

### Global usage

Next, you must ensure MAMP php binary is used globally on your CLI. Therefore, execute the following commands:

```bash
which php
# /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.14/bin/php &lt; should be displayed
# IF NOT
vim ~/.bash_profile
export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.14/bin:$PATH
# :wq to save the file
source ~/.bash_profile
```

::: info
The folder used in `PATH` \(`PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.14/bin:$PATH`\) may change. Please look in the `php` folder for its current name.
:::

Then you need to make sure MAMP mysql binary is used globally on your CLI:

```bash
which mysql
# /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql &lt; should be displayed
# IF NOT
vim ~/.bash_profile
export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin:$PATH
# :wq to save the file
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Install `brew`

It is handy to use brew as a package manager. So we recommend you install brew. Please open the terminal application again and run the command stated below:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Install npm / node

The next step is installing NodeJS and NPM. Therefore you need to leave the terminal application open and use brew to install the node:

```bash
brew install node@12
```

### Install Composer

To install Composer, please open the terminal application and execute the following command:

```bash
brew install composer
```

## Checkout Shopware

Before you are able to set up Shopware, you need to checkout Shopware's repositories. This is explained in the "Preparatory steps" of the [Installation overview](../index.md#installation-overview).  guide. Nevertheless, below you see a brief summary of this process:

```bash
# Choose your own directory
cd ~/PhpstormProjects/
mkdir shopware
cd shopware
git clone https://github.com/shopware/development.git
cd development
git clone https://github.com/shopware/platform.git
```

## Shopware 6 setup in MAMP

First, add a new host in MAMP:

- Hostname = shopware
- Port = 8000
- Document Root = Browse for the public directory inside the new directory that you used before \(e.g.,/PhpstormProjects/shopware/development/public\)

![hosts](../../../.gitbook/assets/10-mac-os-x-net.png)

As a next step, change the installation settings:

```bash
# Inside the shopware installation directory (e.g.  /PhpstormProjects/shopware/development)
bin/setup
```

You will be prompted to enter specific information. In short:

- **Application environment**: Just hit enter to apply the default `dev`.
- **URL to your /public folder**: `http://shopware:8000`.
- **Database host**: Just hit enter to apply the default `localhost`.
- **Database port**: Just hit enter to apply the default `3306`.
- **Database name**: Enter the name of your database that you created earlier, `shopware` was suggested.
- **Database user**: Enter the name of your MySQL user that you created previously.
- **Database password**: Enter the password of the new MySQL user.

Afterwards a file called `.psh.yaml.override` is created, which contains all the information you just entered.

### Start Shopware 6 setup

```bash
# Inside the shopware installation directory (e.g. /PhpstormProjects/shopware/development) 
./psh.phar install
```

After that the setup is done. You can now access your Shopware 6 installation using the following URLs:
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
- **Storefront**: [http://shopware:8000](http://shopware:8000)
- **Admin**: [http://shopware:8000/admin](http://shopware:8000/admin) \(User: admin, password: shopware\)
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

## Troubleshooting

There are cases when the Administration is not built correctly and has error messages similar to these:

> ERROR in foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js Module Error \(from ./node\_modules/eslint-loader/index.js\):
>
> ✘ [https://google.com/\#q=import%2Fno-unresolved](https://google.com/#q=import%2Fno-unresolved) Casing of ./modules/sw-theme-manager does not match the underlying filesystem  
> foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js:1:8
>
> ✘ [https://google.com/\#q=import%2Fno-unresolved](https://google.com/#q=import%2Fno-unresolved) Casing of ./extension/sw-sales-channel/page/sw-sales-channel-detail does not match the underlying filesystem  
> foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js:3:8

> ✘ [https://google.com/\#q=import%2Fno-unresolved](https://google.com/#q=import%2Fno-unresolved) Casing of ./extension/sw-sales-channel/view/sw-sales-channel-detail-theme does not match the underlying filesystem  
> foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js:4:8
>
> ✘ [https://google.com/\#q=import%2Fno-unresolved](https://google.com/#q=import%2Fno-unresolved) Casing of ./init/api-service.init does not match the underlying filesystem  
> foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js:6:8

The underlying problem is that Mac supports case-insensitive paths but not the tools that build the administration. Therefore, make sure to execute the commands in a context where the `pwd` is written in the correct case.

✅ Ok: `/Users/shopware/Code/shopware-platform`

❌ Not ok: `/users/shopware/code/Shopware-Platform`

## Next steps

As you successfully installed Shopware, you may want to start writing your own plugin. Head over to [Plugin base guide](../../plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide) to get a grip on that topic.
