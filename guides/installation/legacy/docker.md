Docker is **not** the recommended way to install Shopware 6 on a Mac when it comes to the default way, due to performance issues. You can still have a look at other possibilities below.

When using Windows, it is recommended to use [Dockware](../community/dockware) or other ways to install Shopware.

## Default way

On Linux OS, Docker installation is the easiest way to get a running Shopware 6. This way you can set up Shopware 6 with just three easy commands:

1. Build and start the containers:

```bash
./psh.phar docker:start
```

1. Access the application container:

```bash
./psh.phar docker:ssh
```

1. Execute the installer inside the docker container:

```bash
./psh.phar install
```

This may take a while since many caches need to be generated on the first execution.

To be sure the installation succeeded, just open the following URL in your browser: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

After exploring Shopware 6, you can terminate it with these two commands:

1. Leave the shell:

```bash
exit
```

1. Stop the containers:

```bash
./psh.phar docker:stop
```

## Possibilities to use Docker on Mac

### Using native mounting with Docker volumes and docker-sync

If you are working with Mac/OSX and are facing performance issues, you should use [docker-sync](http://docker-sync.io/) instead of the default mounting strategy.

### Preparation

Download and install `docker-sync` from [http://docker-sync.io/](http://docker-sync.io/), which supports OSX, Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. `docker-sync` uses Ruby, which is pre-installed on OSX. On other operating systems, you might have to [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) separately.

* For OSX, see [OSX](https://docker-sync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#installation-osx).
* For Windows, see [Windows](https://docker-sync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#installation-windows).
* For Linux, see [Linux](https://docker-sync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#installation-linux).
* See the list of alternatives [here](https://docker-sync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/miscellaneous/alternatives.html)

### Enable the use of docker-sync in PSH console

By default, the usage of `docker-sync` is disabled in PSH. To use Docker Volumes with Docker Sync, you must set `DOCKER_SYNC_ENABLED` to `true` in your `.psh.yaml.override`. Create a new entry in the `const` section like so:

```yaml
const:
  #..
  DOCKER_SYNC_ENABLED: true
```

That's it. Now, continue to install Shopware 6 as usual:

1. **Build and start the containers:**

```bash
./psh.phar docker:start
```

This command creates and starts the containers, watchers, and the sync itself. Running *start* for the first time takes several minutes to complete. Subsequent starts are a lot faster since the images and volumes are reused.

1. **Access the application container:**

```bash
./psh.phar docker:ssh
```

1. **Execute the installer inside the Docker container:**

```bash
./psh.phar install
```

## Next steps

As the next step, you might want to start writing your very own plugin. Refer to [Plugin base guide](../../plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide) to learn about that topic.
