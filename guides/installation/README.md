# Installation Overview

This section discusses ways to set up Shopware on local machines so you can use it as a foundation for your development.

There are a couple of ways to get Shopware running on your system, together with the most useful services for data storage and the web server.

## Installation modes

* [Devenv](devenv.md) installation manages all necessary services. A description file in the source code manages the versions of these services. This setup works for Linux, WSL and macOS.

* Alternatively, [Dockware](community/dockware.md) - This is a managed docker setup for Shopware 6 by Shopware agency [dasistweb](https://www.dasistweb.de/).

## Set up your own environment
  
Refer to the [Requirements](requirements.md) section to install and configure the necessary services like a database and a webserver to a nix system like Linux, macOS, WSL etc.

Next, you can [Setup Shopware as a Symfony flex project](template.md#set-up-a-new-project).
