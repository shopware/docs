# Installation Overview

This section covers setting up Shopware for local development and for deployment to external servers.

## Local Setup

For a local setup, we recommand to go straight to [Setup](./setup.md) which will guide you through the installation process.

## Hosting

For hosting Shopware on a server, please check the available options below.

### Webspace Hosting / Shopware Hosting Partner

If you want to host Shopware at a traditional webspace hosting provider, we recommend creating a local installation first using the [Setup](./setup.md) guide and then [using Deployer](./deployments/deployment-with-deployer.md) to deploy your code to the server.

### PaaS Hosting

If you want to host Shopware on a Shopware PaaS see [Shopware PaaS section](../../products/paas/index.md) for more information.

### Containerized Hosting

If you want to host Shopware in a containerized environment, we recommend creating first a local installation using the [Setup](./setup.md) guide and then [using Docker](./deployments/deployment-with-docker.md) to learn how to build and deploy your containers.
