# Docker

::: info
This setup is intended for development, if you want to use Docker for production, please check out this [guide](../../hosting/installation-updates/docker.md).
:::

Docker is a platform that enables developers to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. These containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. To get started with Docker, you can follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

In this guide, we will run PHP, Node and all required services in Docker containers. If you just want to run the services (MySQL/OpenSearch/Redis/...) in Docker, check out the [Docker + Symfony CLI](./docker+symfony-cli.md) guide.

## Prerequisites

::: info
On macOS we recommend OrbStack, instead of Docker Desktop. OrbStack is a lightweight and fast alternative to Docker Desktop, and it is free for personal use. You can follow the official [OrbStack installation guide](https://orbstack.dev/docs/getting-started/installation) to install OrbStack.
:::

- Docker installed on your machine. You can follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.
- Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can follow the official [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install Docker Compose.
- make installed on your machine. (`apt install make` on Ubuntu, `brew install make` on macOS)

## Create a new project

Create a new empty directory and navigate to it:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Then create a new Project:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/var/www/html ghcr.io/shopwarelabs/devcontainer/base-slim:8.3 new-shopware-setup

# or specific version
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/var/www/html ghcr.io/shopwarelabs/devcontainer/base-slim:8.3 new-shopware-setup 6.6.10.0
```

This will create a new Shopware project in the current directory additionally with a `compose.yaml` and a `Makefile`. The difference to regular `composer create-project` is that we use PHP, Composer from the Docker image and do not need to install PHP and Composer on your local machine.

## Initial Setup

After the project is created, you can run the initial setup commands to install Shopware itself.

First, we need to start the containers

```bash
make up
```

This will start the containers in the background. You can install Shopware through the Browser at <http://localhost:8000> or through the CLI:

```bash
make setup
```

This will install Shopware itself, create an admin user with username `admin` and password `shopware`.

If you want to stop the setup, you can run `make stop` and to start it again, you can run `make up` again. If you want to remove the containers, you can run `make down`. This will remove all containers and **keep the data**. If you want to remove all containers and the data, you can run `docker compose down -v`

## Development

To access the Shopware `bin/console`, you have to enter first the container:

```bash
make shell
```

and run then `bin/console` commands.

You can also run the commands directly from your host machine without entering the container:

```bash
docker compose exec web bin/console cache:clear
```

To build the Administration or Storefront, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Build the administration
make build-administration

# Build the storefront
make build-storefront

# Start watcher for administration
make watch-admin

# Start watcher for storefront
make watch-storefront
```

## Services

The setup comes with the following services:

- Nginx + PHP-FPM at port 8000
- MariaDB at port 3306
- Mailpit at port 8025

### Enable Profiler/Debugging for PHP

To enable XDebug, you will need to create a `compose.override.yaml`

```yaml
services:
    web:
        environment:
            - XDEBUG_MODE=debug
            - XDEBUG_CONFIG=client_host=host.docker.internal
            - PHP_PROFILER=xdebug
```

and then run `docker compose up -d` to apply the changes.

It also supports `blackfire`, `tideways` and `pcov`. For `tideways` and `blackfire` you will need a separate container like:

```yaml
services:
    web:
        environment:
            - PHP_PROFILER=blackfire
    blackfire:
        image: blackfire/blackfire:2
        environment:
            BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID: XXXX
            BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN: XXXX
```

### Using OrbStack Routing

If you are using OrbStack as your Docker provider, you can use the OrbStack routing feature to access your services without needing to manage port mappings.

OrbStack generates for each running container a URL like `https://web.orb.local` and allows for easier access to your services without needing to manage port mappings.
This allows running multiple Shopware instances at the same time without port conflicts.

Create a `compose.override.yaml` with:

```yaml
services:
  web:
      ports: !override []
      environment:
          APP_URL: https://web.sw.orb.local
          SYMFONY_TRUSTED_PROXIES: REMOTE_ADDR

###> symfony/mailer ###
  mailer:
    image: axllent/mailpit
    environment:
      MP_SMTP_AUTH_ACCEPT_ANY: 1
      MP_SMTP_AUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE: 1
###< symfony/mailer ###

```

The APP_URL environment variable always starts with `web.<project-name>.orb.local` and the rest of the URL is generated by the project name. The project name is the folder name of the project. So if you have a project called `shopware`, the URL will be `https://web.shopware.orb.local`. If you have a project called `shopware-6`, the URL will be `https://web.shopware-6.orb.local`.

You can also open `https://orb.local` in your browser and see all running containers and their URLs.

## Proxy Production Images

Typically, you import for local development a copy of the production database to your local environment. This allows you to test changes with production similar data. However, this can lead to issues that all images are missing in the local environment. To avoid this, you can download all images from the production environment and import them into your local environment. Or set up a proxy server that serves the images from the production environment.

To do this, you can add a `imageproxy` service to your `compose.override.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
    imageproxy:
        image: ghcr.io/shopwarelabs/devcontainer/image-proxy
        ports:
          - "8050:80"
        environment:
          # Your production URL.
          REMOTE_SERVER_HOST: shopware.com
```

This will start a proxy server that serves all images from the production environment. In this case if we request `http://localhost:8050/assets/images.png`, it will load `https://[REMOTE_SERVER_HOST]/assets/images.png` and serve it to the local environment, it will also cache the images locally.

Next, we need to configure Shopware to use the proxy server. To do this, create a new YAML file `config/packages/media-proxy.yaml`

```yaml
shopware:
  filesystem:
    public:
      url: "http://localhost:8050"
```

This will tell Shopware to use the proxy server URL for all images.

## Known issues

### Linux host user-id must be 1000

If you are using Docker on Linux, your host user-id must be 1000. This is a known issue with Docker on Linux. You can check your user-id with the following command:

```bash
id -u
```
