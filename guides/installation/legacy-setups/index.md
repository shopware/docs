# Legacy Setups

:::warning
Legacy local development setups are documented here for reference only and are no longer recommended for new projects. Refer to [Install Shopware with Docker](../docker-setup.md) instead.
:::

Legacy development environments:

* [Devenv](./devenv-setup/)
* [Symfony CLI](./symfony-cli-setup/)

These setups may still be in use by external development teams for:

* Existing long-lived projects
* Teams with established local workflows
* Migration scenarios

However, they may not receive the same level of updates or optimization as our current recommended setup.
