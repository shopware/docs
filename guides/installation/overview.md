# Installation overview

## Overview

There are a couple of ways to get Shopware running on your system. Depending on what best suits your development environment, you have the following choices:

* [Docker](docker.md): The docker installation is the easiest way to get a running Shopware 6.
* [MAMP](mamp.md): For quick and easy installation you can also use MAMP tool on mac.
* [Valet+](valet.md): You can install Shopware with the epl of Valet+, which is a fork of laravel/valet. 
* [Dockware](dockware.md): This is a managed docker setup for Shopware 6 by shopware agency dasistweb.
* [Installation from scratch](from-scratch.md): You can install Shopware 6 locally. However, be aware that this will be the more complex solution since additional or changed system requirements need to be managed by you.

## Prerequisites

### System requirements

Before installing Shopware 6, you should take a quick look at the requirements to check if your local environment is capable of running it.

You can use these commands for checking your actual environment:

* `php -v`: Show CLI PHP version
* `php -m`: Show CLI PHP modules
* `php -i | grep memory_limit`: Show your actual CLI PHP memory limit
* `composer -v`: Show your actual composer version
* `node -v`: Show you actual Node version
* `npm -v`: Show you actual NPM version

To get more information about your server PHP setup, you can create a `phpinfo.php` file with this content:

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

When you now open your Browser and go to the `phpinfo.php` page then you can see all information about your actual PHP setup. Check if they also match with the requirements.

#### Operating System

Although Shopware 6 supports most UNIX like environments, we recommend using **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** or  
**macOS Mojave 10.14** to get the best experience.

  * ext-curl
  * ext-dom  
  * ext-fileinfo  
  * ext-gd  
  * ext-iconv

* Zend Opcache \(256M or more\)
* Webserver with HTTP2 support

Adminer \([https://www.adminer.org/](https://www.adminer.org/)\) is our recommended database administration tool since it has better support for binary data types.
{% endhint %}

### Requirements for docker setup

If you are working on Linux there is a curated docker setup, that takes care of setting up the environment for you.

In this case you need:

* PHP 7.4+ CLI
* docker
* docker-compose
* bash

### Setup Templates

Depending on your goal you can choose from **two different** so-called templates for your local Shopware setup.

* Shopware Production Template
* Shopware Development Template

Let's discuss their differences, so you can make an informed decision.

| Task | shopware/production | shopware/development |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Contribute to the Shopware core | ❌ | ✅ |
| Develop an extension for the store | ✅ | ✅ \(preferred\) |
| Build a custom project / deployment | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage dependencies / bundles | ✅ | ❌ |

## Preparatory steps

Either installation method requires you to check out the sources first. Shopware 6 is split into two repositories the [development template](https://github.com/shopware/development) and the [platform](https://github.com/shopware/platform) itself.

Let's start by cloning the development template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shopware/development.git
```

You now have the application template for Shopware 6 in the directory `development`, we now navigate into it:

```bash
cd development
```

Per default the development template has `shopware/platform` in the version `dev-master` as requirement in its `composer.json` file. This always corresponds to the latest commit on the master branch on GitHub. If you want to use a specific version change `dev-master` to `6.1` for example. Now Shopware 6.1 will be installed instead of the latest master state.

Only if you want to work with the Shopware platform code itself, e.g. in order to create a pull request for it, you should clone the `platform` code manually. Before doing so, remove the existing platform directory.

```bash
rm -rf platform
git clone https://github.com/shopware/platform.git
```

Otherwise, the Shopware platform code would be placed into a `vendor/shopware/platform` directory, where you don't want to change any code. There's a good reason why many IDEs try to prevent you from changing code in the `vendor` directory.

## Next steps

As already mentioned, there are several ways to install Shopware. So we got you covered, no matter which operation system or environment you like to use. Head over to whatever way you like:

* [Docker](docker.md)
* [Dockware](dockware.md)
* [Valet+](valet.md)
* [MAMP](mamp.md)
