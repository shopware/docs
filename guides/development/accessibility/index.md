# Accessibility

Shopware is committed to creating inclusive and barrier-free shopping experiences. Accessibility affects both the core Storefront and all custom themes and extensions. Developers are responsible for ensuring that their implementations follow accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1 AA.

## Why accessibility matters

* Legal compliance (e.g., EU accessibility regulations)
* Better usability for all users
* Improved SEO and performance
* Future-proof storefront implementations

Shopware continuously introduces accessibility improvements in new releases. Always test extensions with the `ACCESSIBILITY_TWEAKS` feature flag enabled to ensure compatibility.
