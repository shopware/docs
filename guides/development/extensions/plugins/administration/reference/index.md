# Administration Reference

Plugins extend the Administration by integrating directly into the Vue-based admin framework. Use these guides when building custom admin modules, components, or extending existing ones.

## Core Concepts

* [Utils](utils): Global utility functions available on the `Shopware` object.
* [Mixins](mixins): Shared Vue mixins used across the Administration.
* [Directives](directives): Globally registered Vue directives.

Use these guides to:

* Reuse core functionality instead of reimplementing it
* Follow Administration extension conventions
* Build extensions that integrate cleanly into the Admin UI
