# Advanced Configuration

This section covers advanced Administration and build-related customizations for plugins. Use these guides to extend or override core behavior in a more advanced way:

* <PageRef page="./add-rule-assignment-configuration" />
* <PageRef page="./add-shortcuts" />
* <PageRef page="./extending-webpack" />
* <PageRef page="./modify-blacklist-for-dynamic-product-groups" />

These topics go beyond basic plugin setup and require familiarity with the Administration architecture and component overriding.
