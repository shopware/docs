# Integrations

Plugins are commonly used to integrate external systems and infrastructure services into Shopware. Typical scenarios that go beyond basic plugin setup include:

* Infrastructure integrations, including [Redis](./redis) and [Elasticsearch](./elasticsearch)
* Commercial & API-based integrations, including [customer-specific pricing](./customer-specific-pricing), [multi-inventory](./multi-inventory), and [API](./api)
* Extended search capabilities, including [adding product entity extensions to Elasticsearch](./add-product-entity-extension-to-elasticsearch)

Use these guides when a plugin needs to connect to external services, extend core infrastructure, or integrate ERP and pricing systems.
