# Dependencies

These guides explain how to manage plugin dependencies in Shopware, including plugin requirements, Composer packages, and NPM packages. Use them to:

* Declare dependencies on other plugins
* Add and bundle Composer dependencies
* Install and configure NPM packages for Administration or Storefront

Proper dependency management ensures compatibility, predictable installation behavior, and clean integration with Shopware’s build and package systems.
