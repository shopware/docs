# Monetization

Shopware provides multiple ways to monetize your extension in the Store. Choose the model that fits your business strategy and target audience.

All monetized extensions must comply with our [quality guidelines](./quality-guidelines) and avoid [Common Store Review Errors](./store-review-errors).

## Paid extensions

Sell your extension with a one-time purchase or subscription model via the Shopware Store. Pricing and licensing are managed in your Shopware Account.

## In-App Purchases (IAP)

[In-App Purchases](./in-app-purchases) enable locking specific features behind additional purchases within the same extension. Available since Shopware 6.6.9.0.

## Commission-based integrations (STP)

If your extension integrates external services and generates revenue (e.g. transaction-based fees), a Shopware Technology Partner (STP) agreement may be required. See the [quality guidelines](./quality-guidelines) for details.
