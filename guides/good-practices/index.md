# Good Practices

Flexibility and openness are at shopware's heart; we believe that software and frameworks specifically should work for you and your business case, rather than the other way around.
Therefore, we don't believe in one size fits all solutions and absolutism. But with that in mind, we have seen a ton of projects succeeding by following the same principles, as well as a host of projects failing because of not following them. 
We consider the following guardrails to be generally `good practices` and `best defaults`. When you build shopware-based projects, you definitely should know about those practices and default to following them. Not adhering to those guidelines should always be an explicit decision, where you actively acknowledge the tradeoffs that come with it.
