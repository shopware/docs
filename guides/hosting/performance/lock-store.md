# Lock store

Shopware uses [Symfony's lock component](https://symfony.com/doc/5.4/lock.html) to implement locking functionality.
By default, Symfony will use a local lock store. This means in multi-machine (cluster) setups, naive file locks will break the system; therefore, it is highly recommended to use one of the [supported remote stores](https://symfony.com/doc/5.4/components/lock.html#available-stores).

## Using Redis as a lock store

As Redis can already be used for [caching](./caches), [increment store](./increment), and [session storage](./session), you can also use that Redis host as a remote lock store.
To use Redis, create a `config/packages/lock.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
framework:
    lock: 'redis://host:port'
```

## Other lock stores

As Shopware uses [Symfony's lock component](https://symfony.com/doc/5.4/lock.html), all lock stores supported by Symfony can be used.
Keep in mind that you should always use a remote store if you host Shopware in a cluster setup.
For a list of all available lock stores, refer to [Symfony's documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/5.4/components/lock.html#available-stores).
There is also more detailed information on the [configuration options](https://symfony.com/doc/5.4/lock.html#configuring-lock-with-frameworkbundle).
