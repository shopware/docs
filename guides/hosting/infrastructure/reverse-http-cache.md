# Reverse HTTP Cache

## Overview

A reverse HTTP cache is a cache server placed before the web shop. If you are not familiar with HTTP caching, please refer to the [HTTP cache](../../../concepts/framework/http_cache) concept. The reverse http cache needs the following capabilities to function with Shopware fully:

* Able to differentiate the request with multiple cookies
* Allow clearing the cache using a web request for a specific site or with `/` for all pages

::: info
In this guide, we will use Varnish as an example for HTTP cache.
:::

### The example Setup with Varnish

::: warning
This setup is compatible with Shopware version 6.4 and higher
:::

### Shopware Varnish Docker image

Feel free to check out the [Shopware Varnish Docker image](https://github.com/shopware/varnish-shopware) for a quick start. It contains the Shopware default VCL. The containing VCL is for the usage with xkeys. 

### Configure Shopware

:::warning
From version v6.6.x onwards, this method is deprecated and will be removed in v6.7.0. Utilising Varnish with Redis involves LUA scripts to determine URLs for the BAN request. This can cause problems depending on the setup or network. Furthermore, Redis clusters are not supported. Therefore, it is advisable to opt for the [Varnish with XKey](#using-varnish-xkey-module-without-redis) integration instead.
::: 

First, we need to activate the reverse proxy support in Shopware. To enable it, we need to create a new file in `config/packages/storefront.yaml`:

```yaml
# Be aware that the configuration key changed from storefront.reverse_proxy to shopware.http_cache.reverse_proxy starting with Shopware 6.6
shopware:
    http_cache:
        reverse_proxy:
            enabled: true
            ban_method: "BAN"
            # This needs to point to your varnish hosts
            hosts: [ "http://varnish" ]
            # Max parallel invalidations at same time for a single worker
            max_parallel_invalidations: 3
            # Redis Storage for the HTTP cache tags
            redis_url: "redis://redis"
```

Also set `SHOPWARE_HTTP_CACHE_ENABLED=1` in your `.env` file.

::: info
The configuration key changed from `storefront.reverse_proxy` up to Shopware 6.5.x to `shopware.http_cache.reverse_proxy` starting with Shopware 6.6.0.0.
So you will need to adjust your config while upgrading.
If you look for the old documentation and examples, you can find it [here](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/v6.5/guides/hosting/infrastructure/reverse-http-cache.html)

#### Trusted proxies

For the most part, using Symfony and Varnish doesn't cause any problem. But, when a request passes through a proxy, certain request information is sent using either the standard Forwarded header or *X-Forwarded* headers. For example, instead of reading the *REMOTE_ADDR* header (which will now be the IP address of your reverse proxy), the user's true IP will be stored in a standard Forwarded: for="..." header or an *X-Forwarded-For* header.

If you don't configure Symfony to look for these headers, you will get incorrect information about the client's IP address. Whether or not the client connects via https, the client's port and the hostname are requested.

Go through [Proxies](https://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment/proxies.html) section for more information.

### Configure Varnish

As Shopware is now prepared to work with a reverse proxy, we need to configure Varnish to use a Shopware specific configuration (VCL). Below you can find an example Shopware 6 Varnish configuration.

On hard purge, the cache will be immediately purged and the next requesting user will get a slow response, as the cache has been deleted. On soft purge, the user still gets the cached response after the purge, but in the configured time interval, the cache will be refreshed. This makes sure that the client gets the fastest response possible.

    # invalidation headers are only for internal use
    unset resp.http.sw-invalidation-states;

    set resp.http.X-Cache-Hits = obj.hits;
}
```

To verify if it works, you can look for a new response header `X-Cache` in the HTTP response. It shows you if it was a cache hit or miss.

### Using Varnish XKey module without Redis

Varnish XKey is a cache key module that allows you to use Varnish with surrogate keys. It is a module that is not included in the default Varnish installation. It is available for Varnish 4.1 and 6.0.

The module is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/varnish/varnish-modules/blob/master/src/vmod_xkey.vcc)

And also needs to be enabled in the `config/packages/shopware.yml` file:

```yaml
# Be aware that the configuration key changed from storefront.reverse_proxy to shopware.http_cache.reverse_proxy starting with Shopware 6.6
shopware:
  http_cache:
      reverse_proxy:
        enabled: true
        use_varnish_xkey: true
        hosts:
          - 'varnish-host'
```

### Disable the verification headers

The `X-Cache` and `X-Cache-Hits` headers are only meant to verify that Varnish is doing its job. You typically don't want to have those headers enabled in a production environment.

To disable these headers, comment out the lines by prefixing them with the `#` character. The lines in question are:

```txt
# Set a cache header to allow us to inspect the response headers during testing
if (obj.hits > 0) {
    unset resp.http.set-cookie;
    set resp.http.X-Cache = "HIT";
}  else {
    set resp.http.X-Cache = "MISS";
}

set resp.http.X-Cache-Hits = obj.hits;
```

Make it so that the lines look like the following:

```txt
# Set a cache header to allow us to inspect the response headers during testing
if (obj.hits > 0) {
    unset resp.http.set-cookie;
    #set resp.http.X-Cache = "HIT";
}  else {
    #set resp.http.X-Cache = "MISS";
}

#set resp.http.X-Cache-Hits = obj.hits;
```

For more details, please refer to the [Varnish documentation](https://www.varnish-software.com/developers/tutorials/logging-cache-hits-misses-varnish/) on logging cache hits and misses.

## Configure Fastly

Fastly is supported since Shopware 6.4.11.0 is out-of-the-box with some configurations. To enable it, we need to create a new file in `config/packages/storefront.yaml`

```yaml
# Be aware that the configuration key changed from storefront.reverse_proxy to shopware.http_cache.reverse_proxy starting with Shopware 6.6
shopware:
  http_cache:
    reverse_proxy:
        enabled: true
        fastly:
          enabled: true
          api_key: '<personal-token-from-fastly>'
          service_id: '<service-id>'
```

### Fastly soft-purge

::: warning
This feature has been introduced with Shopware version 6.4.15.0
:::

By default, the cache will be immediately purged and the next requesting user will get a slow response as the cache has been deleted. On soft purge, the user still gets the cached response after the purge, but in the configured time interval, the cache will be refreshed. This makes sure that the client gets the fastest response possible.

```yaml
# Be aware that the configuration key changed from storefront.reverse_proxy to shopware.http_cache.reverse_proxy starting with Shopware 6.6
shopware:
  http_cache:
    # Allow to serve the out-dated cache for 300 seconds
    stale_while_revalidate: 300
    # Allow to serve the out-dated cache for an hour if the origin server is offline
    stale_if_error: 3600
    reverse_proxy:
        enabled: true
        fastly:
          enabled: true
          api_key: '<personal-token-from-fastly>'
          service_id: '<service-id>'
          soft_purge: '1'
```

### Fastly VCL Snippets

Additionally, we need to set up some VCL Snippets in the Fastly interface:
