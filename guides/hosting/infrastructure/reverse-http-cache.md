# Reverse Http Cache

A reverse http cache is a cache server placed before the web shop. If you are not familar with http caching, please see our [http cache concept](../../../concepts/framework/http_cache.md). The reverse http cache needs the following capabilities to fully function with Shopware:

- Able to differentiate the reqeuest with multiple cookies
- Allow clearing the cache using a web request for a specific site or with `/` for all pages


Next we will use Varnish as example for an http cache.

### The example Setup with Varnish

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/reverse_proxy_setup.svg)


As first we need to activate the reverse proxy support in Shopware. To enable it we need to create a new file in `config/packages/storefront.yaml`
```yaml
storefront:
    csrf:
        enabled: true
        # The internal Shopware http cache replaces the csrf token on the fly. This can't be done in Reverse proxy. So we use ajax to get an csrf token
        mode: ajax
    reverse_proxy:
        enabled: true
        ban_method: "BAN"
        # This needs to point to your varnish hosts
        hosts: [ "http://varnish" ]
        # Max parallel invalidations at same time for a single worker
        max_parallel_invalidations: 3
        # Redis Storage for the http cache tags
        redis_url: "redis://redis" 
```

Also set `SHOPWARE_HTTP_CACHE_ENABLED=1` in your `.env` file.

As Shopware is now prepared to work with a reverse proxy, we need to configure our Varnish too using a Shopware specific configuration. Below you can find an example Varnish configuration.

```vcl
vcl 4.0;

import std;

# You should specificy here all your app nodes and use round robin to select a backend
backend default {
    .host = "<app-host>";
    .port = "80";
}

# ACL for purgers IP. (This needs to contain app server ips)
acl purgers {
    "127.0.0.1";
    "localhost";
    "::1";
}

            return (synth(405, "Method not allowed"));
        }

        ban("req.url ~ "+req.url);

    if (req.url ~ "^/(checkout|account|admin|api)(/.*)?$") {
        return (pass);
    }

    return (hash);
}

sub vcl_hash {
    # Consider Shopware http cache cookies
    if (req.http.cookie ~ "sw-cache-hash=") {
        hash_data("+context=" + regsub(req.http.cookie, "^.*?sw-cache-hash=([^;]*);*.*$", "\1"));

sub vcl_hit {

sub vcl_backend_response {
    # Fix Vary Header in some cases

        set beresp.http.Vary = regsub(beresp.http.Vary, "^, *", "");
        if (beresp.http.Vary == "") {
            unset beresp.http.Vary;
        }
    }

    # Respect the Cache-Control=private header from the backend
    if (
        beresp.http.Pragma        ~ "no-cache" ||
        beresp.http.Cache-Control ~ "no-cache" ||
        beresp.http.Cache-Control ~ "private"
    ) {
        set beresp.ttl = 0s;
        set beresp.http.X-Cacheable = "NO:Cache-Control=private";
        set beresp.uncacheable = true;
        return (deliver);
    }

    # strip the cookie before the image is inserted into cache.
    if (bereq.url ~ "\.(png|gif|jpg|swf|css|js|webp)$") {
        unset beresp.http.set-cookie;
    }

    # Allow items to be stale if needed.
    set beresp.grace = 6h;

sub vcl_deliver {
    ## we don't want the client to cache
    set resp.http.Cache-Control = "max-age=0, private";

    if (req.http.cookie ~ "session-") {

    }  else {

    }

    set resp.http.X-Cache-Hits = obj.hits;
}
```

To verify if it works, you can look for a new response header `X-Cache` in the http response. It shows you if it was a cache hit or miss.
