# Legacy Setups

This section documents legacy local development setups that are no longer recommended for new projects. Please refer to the [Docker development setup](../installation/docker-setup/) instead.

The following legacy development environments are covered here:

- [Devenv](./devenv-setup/)
- [Symfony CLI](./symfony-cli-setup/)

These setups may still be in use by external development teams for:
- Existing long-lived projects
- Teams with established local workflows
- Migration scenarios

However, they may not receive the same level of updates or optimization as our current recommended setup.
