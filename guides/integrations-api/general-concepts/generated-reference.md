# Generated Reference

Shopware generates schemas for both HTTP APIs that can be interpreted by API client libraries and documentation tools, such as [Swagger.io](https://swagger.io/).

These schemas are generated using PHP annotations based on the [swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php) library. When building API extensions, you can also leverage these annotations to let Shopware generate standardized endpoint documentation for your custom endpoints on-the-fly.

::: warning
Due to security restrictions, your **`APP_ENV`** environment variable has to be set to **`dev`** to access any of the specifications described below.
:::

## Swagger UI

The easiest way to access the generated schema is Swagger UI. [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) is a small library that takes an OpenAPI specification and renders it into a more accessible user interface. Shopware already ships with these user interfaces. They are accessible at the following endpoint relative to their respective base path:

```text
/(api|store-api)/_info/swagger.html
```

::: info
The above path is relative and contains `api` (Admin API) and `store-api` seperated by a pipe. Please choose the appropriate option.
:::

## OpenAPI schema

If you don't want to bother with the UI but just fetch the schema definition instead, use the following endpoint:

```text
/(api|store-api)/_info/openapi3.json
```

## Entity schema

If you would like to access the schema definitions of all available entities instead of an endpoint reference, use one of the corresponding schema endpoints instead:

```text
/(api|store-api)/_info/open-api-schema.json
```
