# General Concepts

Even though the Admin API and the Store API serve very different purposes, they have some commonalities handy to be aware of.

## Querying data

For the Admin API these apply to the `/search` endpoint, whilst for the Store API they apply to almost every endpoint that returns a list of records.

It starts with a very simple underlying concept, which encapsulates your entire search description in one generic object, referred to as the **search criteria**.

There are some additional instructions that can be specified using **request headers**.

## API Versioning

These topics provide essential foundations for effective API development and usage in Shopware.
