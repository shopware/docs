# Shopware Acceptance Test Suite: Playwright

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is a powerful tool for end-to-end testing of web applications. It allows you to automate browser interactions, making it ideal for testing the functionality of your [Shopware](https://github.com/shopware/shopware) plugins and themes.

It provides several useful Playwright [fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures) to start testing with Shopware right away, including page contexts and [page objects](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom) for Storefront and Administration, API clients, test data creation, and reusable test logic.
