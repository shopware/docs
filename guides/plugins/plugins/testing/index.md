# Testing

When it comes to testing, you might immediately think about unit tests. Of course, we have got you covered then:

<PageRef page="php-unit" />

The following section also covers unit tests in [Storefront](./jest-storefront.md) and [Administration](./jest-admin.md).

Even though unit tests are definitely great, you might want to do some end-to-end testing, which is covered here:

<PageRef page="playwright/index" />

<PageRef page="cypress/cypress-end-to-end-testing" />
