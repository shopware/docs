# Media

Shopware Media offers the ability to add media file extensions and prevent the deletion of media files within the e-commerce platform.

With the Media plugin, users can specify and configure new media file extensions. This allows businesses to define different types of media files, such as images, videos, or documents, that can be uploaded and used within the Shopware platform.

Furthermore, the plugin helps prevent the deletion of media files that are not used in your application.
