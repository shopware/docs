# SEO

The Shopware SEO feature offers comprehensive tools to optimize the search engine visibility of your e-commerce platform.

## SEO URLs

You can create custom SEO URLs for product pages, categories, content pages, and other relevant sections of the website. The plugin allows businesses to customize meta tags for each page, including meta titles, descriptions, and keywords. This enables users to optimize the on-page SEO elements, providing search engines with relevant information about the content of the page.

## robots.txt

Shopware provides full support for robots.txt configuration, including all standard directives, user-agent blocks, and extensibility through events. You can customize how search engine crawlers interact with your shop by extending the robots.txt parsing and generation.
