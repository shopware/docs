# Plugins

Shopware plugins are extensions that enhance the functionality and features of the Shopware e-commerce platform. Plugins are designed to extend the core capabilities of Shopware and offer additional functionalities that are not available out of the box. While apps and themes are also extensions but they differ from plugins. To better understand the differences, take a look at the [Overview](../../../guides/plugins/overview) article.


## Types of plugins
There are different types of plugins in terms of their folder structure and functionality.

### Plugins
SHOPWARE_ROOT/custom/plugins contains all plugins from the shopware store. The plugins are installed and managed via the Shopware administration.

### Static plugins
SHOPWARE_ROOT/custom/static-plugins contains all plugins that are project-specific and are typically committed to the git repository. Static plugins are plugins that are not installed via the Shopware administration.
