# Store API

The Store API plugin in Shopware enables the addition of custom endpoints to the existing Store API and the ability to override or extend the functionality of existing endpoints. This allows developers to customize the API according to their specific requirements, providing additional functionality or modifying the behavior of existing endpoints.
