# Rate Limiter

A rate limiter controls the rate or frequency at which API requests can be made. It sets limits on the number of requests that can be processed within a specified time period, preventing excessive usage. Hence eliminating the chance of brute-force attacks. Rate limiters help maintain system stability, protect against misuse, and ensure fair resource allocation by enforcing predefined limits on the rate of incoming requests.
