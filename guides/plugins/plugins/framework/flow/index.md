# Flow

The flow builder plugin allows businesses to create and manage custom workflows and automation within the e-commerce platform, enhancing efficiency and streamlining processes. The flow builder mainly comprises actions and triggers.

The customizable flow actions allow the automation of various tasks or processes, while the custom flow triggers are the events or conditions that initiate the execution of this flow. These customizations can be defined and executed within the flow builder enabling businesses to respond dynamically to specific events or changes in their e-commerce platform.
