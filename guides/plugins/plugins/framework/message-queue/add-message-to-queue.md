# Add message to queue

## Overview

::: warning
Parts of this guide refer to the `low_priority` queue and the corresponding `LowPriorityMessageInterface`, which is only available in version 6.5.7.0 and above. Configuring the messenger to consume this queue will fail if it does not exist.
:::

In this guide you'll learn how to create a message and add it to the queue.

Shopware integrates with the [Symfony Messenger](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.html) component and [Enqueue](https://enqueue.forma-pro.com/). This gives you the possibility to send and handle asynchronous messages.

A [message](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html#creating-a-message-handler) is a simple PHP object that you want to dispatch over the MessageQueue. It must be serializable and should contain all necessary information that your handlers need to process the message.

It will be wrapped in an [envelope](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.html#adding-metadata-to-messages-envelopes) by the message bus that dispatches the message.

## Prerequisites

As most guides, this guide is also built upon the [Plugin base guide](../../plugin-base-guide), but you don't necessarily need that. It will use an example service, so if you don't know how to add a custom service yet, have a look at our guide about [Adding a custom service](../../plugin-fundamentals/add-custom-service). Furthermore, registering classes or services to the DI container is also not explained here, but it's covered in our guide about [Dependency injection](../../plugin-fundamentals/dependency-injection), so having this open in another tab won't hurt.

## Create a message

First, we have to create a new message class in the directory `<plugin root>/MessageQueue/Message`. In this example, we create a `SmsNotification` that contains a string with content. By default, all messages are handled synchronously. To change the behavior to asynchronously, we have to implement the `AsyncMessageInterface` interface. For messages which should also be handled asynchronously but with a lower priority, implement the `LowPriorityMessageInterface` interface.

Here's an example:

```php
// <plugin root>/src/MessageQueue/Message/SmsNotification.php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Swag\BasicExample\MessageQueue\Message;

use Shopware\Core\Framework\MessageQueue\AsyncMessageInterface;

class SmsNotification implements AsyncMessageInterface
{
    private string $content;

    public function __construct(string $content)
    {
        $this->content = $content;
    }

    public function getContent(): string
    {
        return $this->content;
    }
}
```

## Send a message

After we've created our notification, we will create a service that will send our `SmsNotification`. We will name this service `ExampleSender`. In this service we need to inject the `Symfony\Component\Messenger\MessageBusInterface`, that is needed to send the message through the desired bus, which is called `messenger.bus.shopware`.

```php
// <plugin root>/src/Service/ExampleSender.php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Swag\BasicExample\Service;

use Swag\BasicExample\MessageQueue\Message\SmsNotification;
use Symfony\Component\Messenger\MessageBusInterface;

class ExampleSender
{
    private MessageBusInterface $bus;

    public function __construct(MessageBusInterface $bus)
    {
        $this->bus = $bus;
    }

    public function sendMessage(string $message): void
    {
        $this->bus->dispatch(new SmsNotification($message));
    }
}
```

If we want to add metadata to our message, we can dispatch an `Symfony\Component\Messenger\Envelope` in our service instead with the necessary [stamps](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.html#adding-metadata-to-messages-envelopes). In this example below, we use the `Symfony\Component\Messenger\Stamp\DelayStamp`, which tells the queue to process the message later.

```php
// <plugin root>/src/Service/ExampleSender.php
public function sendMessage(string $message): void
{
    $message = new SmsNotification($message);
    $this->bus->dispatch(
        (new Envelope($message))
            ->with(new DelayStamp(5000))
    );
}
```

## Lower the priority for specific async messages

You might consider using the new `low_priority` queue if you are dispatching messages that do not need to be handled immediately. To configure specific messages to be transported via the `low_priority` queue, you need to either adjust the routing or implement the `LowPriorityMessageInterface` as already mentioned:

```yaml
# config/packages/framework.yaml
framework:
    messenger:
        routing_overwrite:
            'Your\Custom\Message': low_priority
```

## Override transport for specific messages

If you explicitly configure a message to be transported via the `async` (default) queue, even though it implements the `LowPriorityMessageInterface`, which would usually be transported via the `low_priority` queue, the transport is overridden for this specific message.

Example:
```php
// <plugin root>/src/MessageQueue/Message/LowPriorityMessage.php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Your\Custom;

use Shopware\Core\Framework\MessageQueue\LowPriorityMessageInterface;

class LowPriorityMessage implements LowPriorityMessageInterface
{
}
```

```yaml
# config/packages/framework.yaml
framework:
    messenger:
        routing_overwrite:
            'Shopware\Core\Framework\MessageQueue\LowPriorityMessageInterface': low_priority
            'Your\Custom\LowPriorityMessage': async
```

## Next steps

Now that you know how to create a message and add it to the queue, let's create a handler to process our message. To do this, head over to [Add message handler](add-message-handler) guide.
