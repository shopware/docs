# Custom Fields

Custom fields in Shopware refer to additional data fields that can be added to entities such as products, customers, or orders. These fields allow businesses to store and manage extra information that may be specific to their operations.

With custom fields, you can define and store data beyond the standard attributes provided by Shopware. For example, a clothing store might add a custom field to track fabric composition, while a hardware store could add a custom field to store product dimensions.

Through the administration or via the API, users can create and manage custom fields, define their data types (such as text, number, date, etc.), and assign them to specific entities. This allows businesses the ability to extend the default data structure enabling a more tailored and personalized e-commerce experience.
