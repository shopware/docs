# Event

Shopware events provide a flexible and powerful way to extend the functionality of the e-commerce platform. Events in Shopware are triggered at specific actions. You can extend the platform's functionality by intercepting and executing custom logic during specific system actions. By leveraging events like Storefront events, administration events, or flow builder events, to mention a few,  developers can hook into core system actions, such as order placement or product updates, and perform additional tasks, such as sending notifications, modifying data, or integrating with external services, etc. This event-driven architecture enables seamless integration of custom functionalities, making it easier to extend and customize the Shopware platform to meet specific business requirements.
