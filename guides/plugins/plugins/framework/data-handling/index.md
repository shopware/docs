# Data Handling/DataAbstractionLayer

The data handling, or the Data Abstraction Layer \(DAL\), can be an overwhelming topic. Yet, if you know the right start, it will be fairly easy to deal with.

Hence, here are some good starting topics:

<PageRef page="add-custom-complex-data" />

<PageRef page="reading-data" />

<PageRef page="writing-data" />

Also, [listening to events](using-database-events) of the DAL will come in handy for sure.
