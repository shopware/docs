# API

Commercial plugins are pre-built extensions developed by third-party vendors that offer specific features and integrations. In some cases, commercial plugins may expose their own APIs, which developers can use to interact with the plugin's functionalities allowing customization and integration with other systems.

Overall, commercial plugins and APIs work together to expand the capabilities of the Shopware platform. Commercial plugins offer ready-to-use solutions, while APIs provide the flexibility for developers to build custom integrations and extend the functionality of Shopware even further.
