# Order

Orders in Shopware encompass the essential capabilities related to managing and processing orders within the e-commerce platform, including order placement, order management, order status tracking, order customization, order notifications, and order history. While these functions are typically available within the Shopware core system, plugins offer the flexibility to extend or customize them based on specific business needs.
