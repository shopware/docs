# Add Payment Plugin

::: warning
With Shopware 6.6.5.0, the payment handling was refactored.
Most of this documentation is deprecated and obsolete with 6.7.0.0.

The new payment handling is done via a single `AbstractPaymentHandler`.
Check out the new documentation here: [Add Payment Plugin (>6.7)](/docs/v6.7/guides/plugins/plugins/checkout/payment/add-payment-plugin.html).
:::

## Overview

Payments are an essential part of the checkout process. 
That's why Shopware 6 offers an easy platform on which you can build payment plugins.

## Prerequisites

The examples mentioned in this guide are built upon our plugin base guide.

<PageRef page="../../plugin-base-guide.md" title="Plugin base guide"/>

If you want to understand the payment process in detail, head to our Payment Concept.

<PageRef page="../../../../../concepts/commerce/checkout-concept/payments" title="Payment Concept"/>

## Creating a custom payment handler

To create a payment method with your plugin, you have to add a custom payment handler.

Shopware provides you with a handy `Shopware\Core\Checkout\Payment\Cart\PaymentHandler\AbstractPaymentHandler` abstract class for you to extend to get you started quickly.

### Registering the service

Before we're going to have a look at some examples, we need to register our new service to the [Dependency Injection](../../plugin-fundamentals/dependency-injection) container.
Please make sure to add the `shopware.payment.method` tag to your service definition, otherwise Shopware won't recognize your service as a payment handler.

We'll use a class called `MyCustomPaymentHandler` here.

```xml [<plugin root>/src/Resources/config/services.xml]
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

    <services>
        <service id="Swag\PaymentPlugin\Service\MyCustomPaymentHandler">
            <tag name="shopware.payment.method"/>
        </service>
    </services>
</container>
```

Now, let's start with the actual examples.

### Example payment handlers

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Synchronous">

The following will be a synchronous example, so that no redirect will happen, and the payment can be handled in the shop. 
Therefore, you don't have to return a `RedirectResponse` in the `pay` method; no `finalize` method is necessary either.

Therefore, changing the `stateId` of the order should already be done in the `pay` method since there will be no `finalize` method. 
If you have to execute some logic that might fail, e.g., a call to an external API, you should throw a `PaymentException`. 
Shopware 6 will handle this exception and set the transaction to the `failed` state.

::: code-group

```php [MyCustomPaymentHandler.php]
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Swag\PaymentPlugin\Service;

use Shopware\Core\Checkout\Order\Aggregate\OrderTransaction\OrderTransactionStateHandler;
use Shopware\Core\Checkout\Payment\Cart\PaymentHandler\AbstractPaymentHandler;

{
    public function __construct(private readonly OrderTransactionStateHandler $transactionStateHandler)
    {
    }

    public function supports(PaymentHandlerType $type, string $paymentMethodId, Context $context): bool
    {
        // This payment handler does not support recurring payments nor refunds
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * This method is always called during the checkout.
     * You should process the payment here and return a RedirectResponse if the payment process requires an asynchronous approach.
     * In that case, the finalize method will be called additionally during checkout after the redirect.
     * If the payment process is synchronous, you should return null.
     */
    public function pay(Request $request, PaymentTransactionStruct $transaction, Context $context, ?Struct $validateStruct): ?RedirectResponse
    {
        // In here you should probably call your payment provider to precess the payment
        // $this->>myPaymentProvider->processPayment($transaction);

        // afterward you should update the transaction with the new state
        $this->transactionStateHandler->process($transaction->getOrderTransactionId(), $context);

        return null;
    }
}
```

:::

This payment handler does not do a lot in the current state but is a good starting point for your custom payment handler.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Asynchronous">

In the asynchronous example, the customer gets redirected to an external payment provider, 
which then, in return, has to redirect your customer back to your shop. 
Therefore, you must first redirect your customer to the payment provider by returning a `RedirectResponse`.

Also, you need a `finalize` method to properly handle your customer when he was returned to your shop. 
This is where you check the payment state and set the order transaction state accordingly.

Let's have a look at an example implementation of your custom asynchronous payment handler:

::: code-group

```php [MyCustomPaymentHandler.php]
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Swag\BasicExample\Service;

use Shopware\Core\Framework\Context;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

class MyCustomPaymentHandler extends AbstractPaymentHandler
{
    public function __construct(private readonly OrderTransactionStateHandler $transactionStateHandler)
    {
    }

    public function supports(PaymentHandlerType $type, string $paymentMethodId, Context $context): bool
    {
        // This payment handler does not support recurring payments nor refunds
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * This method is always called during the checkout.
     * You should process the payment here and return a RedirectResponse.
     * After redirect the finalize method will be called.
     */
    public function pay(Request $request, PaymentTransactionStruct $transaction, Context $context, ?Struct $validateStruct): ?RedirectResponse
    {
        // Method that sends the return URL to the external gateway and gets a redirect URL back
        try {
            $redirectUrl = $this->sendReturnUrlToExternalGateway($transaction->getReturnUrl());
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            throw PaymentException::asyncProcessInterrupted(
                $transaction->getOrderTransactionId(),
                'An error occurred during the communication with external payment gateway' . PHP_EOL . $e->getMessage()
            );
        }

        // Redirect to external gateway
        return new RedirectResponse($redirectUrl);
    }

    /**
     * This method will be called after redirect from the external payment provider.
     */
    public function finalize(Request $request, PaymentTransactionStruct $transaction, Context $context): void
    {
        // Example check if the user canceled. Might differ for each payment provider
        if ($request->query->getBoolean('cancel')) {
            throw PaymentException::customerCanceled(
                $transaction->getOrderTransactionId(),
                'Customer canceled the payment on the PayPal page'
            );
        }

        // handle the payment state
        $this->>transactionStateHandler->paid($transaction->getOrderTransactionId(), $context);
    }

    private function sendReturnUrlToExternalGateway(string $getReturnUrl): string
    {
        $paymentProviderUrl = '';

        // Do some API Call to your payment provider

        return $paymentProviderUrl;
    }
}
```

```xml [services.xml]
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

        </service>
    </services>
</container>
```

:::

Let's start with the `pay` method. You'll have to start by letting your external payment provider know where he should redirect your customer in return when the payment is done. 
This is usually done by making an API call and transmitting the return URL, which you can fetch from the passed `PaymentTransactionStruct` using the method `getReturnUrl`. 
Since this is just an example, the method `sendReturnUrlToExternalGateway` is empty. 
Fill in your logic in there in order to actually send the return URL to the external payment provider.
The last thing you need to do, is to redirect your customer to the external payment provider by returning a `RedirectResponse`.
Shopware handles the redirect for you automatically.

Once your customer is done at the external payment provider, he will be redirected back to your shop. 
This is where the `finalize` method will be executed. 
In here, you have to check whether the payment process was successful. 
If e.g., the customer canceled the payment process, you'll have to throw a `PaymentException::customerCanceled` exception.

Otherwise, you can proceed to check if the payment status was successful. 
If so, set the order's transaction state to `paid`. 
If not, you could, e.g. reopen the order's transaction.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Prepared">

To improve the payment workflow on headless systems or reduce orders without payment, payment handlers can implement an additional method to support pre-created payments. 
The client (e.g. a single-page application) can prepare the payment directly with the payment service (not through Shopware) and pass a transaction reference (token) to Shopware to complete the payment.

Two steps are necessary: 
The handler has to validate the payment beforehand, or throw an exception, if the validation fails. 
If the validation is successful, the payment handler has to capture the payment in the `pay` method.

Let's have a look at a simple example:

::: code-group

        }

        $token = $dataBag->get('my-payment-token');

        // other checks could include comparing the cart value with the actual payload of your PSP

    }

Recurring payment handlers allow continuous charging of a customer's payment method.
This is especially useful for subscription-based services.

::: info
A full-fledged Subscriptions feature with recurring payments is available exclusively through our [paid plans](https://www.shopware.com/en/pricing/).

Usually, a billing agreement between the customer and the payment provider is necessary to allow recurring payments.

## Setting up the new payment method

The handler itself is not used yet, since there is no payment method actually using the handler created above. 
In short: Your handler is not handling any payment method so far. 
The payment method can be added to the system while installing your plugin.

An example for your plugin could look like this:

::: code-group

<?php declare(strict_types=1);

            // the technicalName helps you to identify the payment method uniquely
            // it is best practice to use a plugin specific prefix to avoid conflicts
            'technicalName' => 'swag_example-example_payment',
        ];

        $paymentRepository = $this->container->get('payment_method.repository');

    }

    private function setPaymentMethodIsActive(bool $active, Context $context): void
    {

        $paymentMethodId = $this->getPaymentMethodId();

        }

        $paymentMethod = [

        ];

    }

    private function getPaymentMethodId(): ?string
    {
        $paymentRepository = $this->container->get('payment_method.repository');

        // Fetch ID for update
        $paymentCriteria = (new Criteria())->addFilter(new EqualsFilter('handlerIdentifier', ExamplePayment::class));
        return $paymentRepository->searchIds($paymentCriteria, Context::createDefaultContext())->firstId();
    }
}
```

:::

In the `install` method, you start by creating a new payment method, if it doesn't exist yet.
If you need to know what's happening in there, you might want to have a look at our guide regarding [Writing data](../../framework/data-handling/writing-data).

::: danger
**Do not** do the opposite in the `uninstall` method and remove the payment method. 
This might lead to data inconsistency if the payment method was used in some orders. 
Instead, only deactivate the method!
:::

The `activate` method and `deactivate` method just do that, activating and deactivating the payment method, respectively.

### Identify your payment

You can identify your payment by the entity property `formattedHandlerIdentifier`. 
It shortens the original handler identifier \(php class reference\): `Custom/Payment/SEPAPayment` to `handler_custom_sepapayment`. 
The syntax for the shortening can be looked up in [Shopware\Core\Checkout\Payment\DataAbstractionLayer\PaymentHandlerIdentifierSubscriber](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/v6.3.4.1/src/Core/Checkout/Payment/DataAbstractionLayer/PaymentHandlerIdentifierSubscriber.php).

Otherwise, you can use your given technical name to uniquely identify your payment method.

## Migrating payment handlers from 6.6

If you are migrating a payment handler from a version before 6.7, 
you need to move from the existing interfaces to the new abstract class and add your own order data loading..

### Payment handler interfaces removed

Instead of implementing multiple interfaces of `Shopware\Core\Checkout\Payment\Cart\PaymentHandler\PaymentHandlerInterface` in your payment handler,
extend the `Shopware\Core\Checkout\Payment\Cart\PaymentHandler\AbstractPaymentHandler` class and implement the necessary methods.

| Old interface                         | Method used in payment handler                                                                            | Checks for `supports` method    |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `SynchronousPaymentHandlerInterface`  | `pay`: always called during checkout                                                                      | -                               |
| `AsynchronousPaymentHandlerInterface` | `finalize`: only called, if `pay` returns a `RedirectResponse`                                            | -                               |
| `PreparedPaymentHandlerInterface`     | `validate`: be aware that this method is always called and can be used to validate a cart during checkout | -                               |
| `RecurringPaymentHandlerInterface`    | `recurring`                                                                                               | `PaymentHandlerType::RECURRING` |
| `RefundPaymentHandlerInterface`       | `refund`                                                                                                  | `PaymentHandlerType::REFUND`    |

### New single tag for payment handlers

Your payment handler should now have a single tag in the service definition: `shopware.payment.method`.
Remove any other occurrences of the following tags:
`shopware.payment.method.sync`, `shopware.payment.method.async`, `shopware.payment.method.prepared`, `shopware.payment.method.recurring`, `shopware.payment.method.refund`.

            <tag name="shopware.payment.method.refund"/>
        </service>
    </services>
</container>
```

### Prepared payments

In the past, you would have to implement the `validate` and `capture` methods when dealing with the `PreparedPaymentHandlerInterface`.

Now, you only have to implement the `validate` method.
Instead of the `capture` method, the streamlined `pay` method is used and has to be implemented.
