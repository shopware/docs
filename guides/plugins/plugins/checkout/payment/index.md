# Payment

Payment feature in Shopware encompasses the essential capabilities related to processing and managing payments within the e-commerce platform, including integrating payment methods, tracking payment status, handling refunds and cancellations, and sending payment notifications. While these functions are typically available within the Shopware core system, plugins offer flexibility to extend or customize them based on specific business requirements, compliance needs, or integration with preferred payment providers.
