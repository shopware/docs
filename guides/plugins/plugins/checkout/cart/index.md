# Cart

Cart core functions as a plugin in Shopware include adding products to the cart, displaying cart contents, adding discounts to line items, updating cart items, adding custom prices to line items, applying tax rates, proceeding to checkout, persisting cart data, integrating with the checkout process, and validating the cart. While these functions are typically available within the Shopware core system, plugins can enhance and customize them according to specific business requirements or customer preferences.
