# Rule Builder

Shopware allows you to enhance the capabilities of the rule builder by adding custom rules from an app. By creating a custom app and defining your own rules, you can incorporate specific conditions and actions based on your business requirements. This empowers you to create dynamic and personalized customer experiences, such as customized promotions, targeted discounts, or advanced product recommendations.

Starting with version 6.4.12.0, apps are able to [add custom rule conditions](./add-custom-rule-conditions) for use in the [Rule Builder](../../../../concepts/framework/rule).
