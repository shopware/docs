# CMS

Shopware allows you to extend the content management capabilities of the platform by adding a custom CMS block from an app. By creating a custom app, you can define and integrate your own unique CMS blocks. These blocks can contain custom content, such as text, images, or HTML, and can be positioned within the CMS layout according to your requirements. Once the app is installed and activated, the custom CMS block becomes available within the Shopware administration panel, empowering you to create engaging and tailored content for your online store.
