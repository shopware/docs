# Administration

You can't extend the Shopware Administration by means of freely overriding and extending Administration components, all js files you provide in the `Resources/administration` namespace will be ignored. Instead, you have more defined extension points and can extend the Administration by other means: You are able to [add your own modules](add-custom-modules.md), [custom fields](../custom-data/custom-fields.md) or [action buttons](add-custom-action-button.md) via manifest file.

Starting with version 6.4.2.0 you can also extend Shopware's CMS module by [adding custom CMS blocks](../content/cms/add-custom-cms-blocks.md).
