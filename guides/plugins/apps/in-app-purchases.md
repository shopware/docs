# In-App Purchases

::: info
In-App Purchase is available since Shopware version 6.6.9.0
:::

In-App Purchases are a way to lock certain features behind a paywall within the same extension.
This is useful for developers who want to offer a free version of their extension with limited features and a paid version with more features.

## Allow users to buy an In-App Purchase

In order to enable others to purchase your In-App Purchase, you must request a checkout for it via the `sw.iap.purchase()` function of the [Meteor Admin SDK](https://github.com/shopware/meteor/tree/main/packages/admin-sdk).
The checkout process itself is provided by Shopware.
As this is purely functional, it is your responsibility to provide a button and hide it if the IAP cannot be purchased more than once.

```vue
<template>
    <!-- ... -->
    <p>
        If you buy this you'll get an incredible useful feature: ...
    </p>
    <mt-button @click="onClick">
        Buy
    </mt-button>
    <!-- ... -->
</template>

<script setup>
import * as sw from '@shopware/meteor-admin-sdk';

function onClick() {
    sw.iap.purchase({ identifier: 'my-iap-identifier' });
}
</script>
```

Alternatively, you can trigger a checkout manually by sending a properly formatted
[post message](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) with an In-App purchase identifier to the Admin.

## Check active In-App Purchases

Whenever Shopware sends you a request, you'll receive a [JWT](../../../../concepts/framework/in-app-purchases.md#token) as a query parameter `in-app-purchases` or in the request body as `inAppPurchases` as part of the `source`, depending on whether the request is a GET or POST. The claims of the JWT will contain all bought In-App Purchases.

### Symfony or PHP app servers

You can use the `shopware/app-php-sdk` for plain PHP or the `shopware/app-bundle` for Symfony to validate and decode the JWT.
An example for plain PHP is available [here](https://github.com/shopware/app-php-sdk/blob/main/examples/index.php).
For Symfony applications, use the appropriate action argument for your route.

#### Admin

You will also receive In-App Purchases with the initial `sw-main-hidden` admin request.
To make them accessible, inject them into your JavaScript application.

Here is an example of retrieving active In-App Purchases in an example `admin.html.twig` using the `shopware/app-bundle`:

```php
#[Route(path: '/app/admin', name: 'admin')]
public function admin(ModuleAction $action): Response {
    return $this->render('admin.html.twig', [
        'inAppPurchases' => $action->inAppPurchases->all(),
    ]);
}
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script>
            try {
                window.inAppPurchases = JSON.parse('{{ inAppPurchases | json_encode | raw }}');
            } catch (e) {
                window.inAppPurchases = {};
                console.error('Unable to decode In-App Purchases', e);
            }
        </script>

        <!-- ... -->
    </head>

    <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

### Non-PHP app servers

To validate In-App Purchase tokens on non-PHP app servers, use a JWT/JOSE library appropriate for your language.
These tokens are signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and include the list of purchased features in their claims. To ensure the token’s authenticity,
you must verify its signature using Shopware’s public keys, available as a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) at `https://api.shopware.com/inappfeatures/jwks`.

Most modern JWT libraries support loading JWKS endpoints directly. After successful verification, you can extract and use the claims to enable or restrict features based on the user’s purchases.

Example (Node.js with `jose`):

```js
import { jwtVerify, createRemoteJWKSet } from 'jose';

const JWKS = createRemoteJWKSet(new URL('https://api.shopware.com/inappfeatures/jwks'));

const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS);
console.log(payload); // Contains list of purchased IAP identifiers
```

## Event

Apps are also able to manipulate the available In-App Purchases as described in
