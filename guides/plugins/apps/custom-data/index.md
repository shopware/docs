# Custom data

You are able to store custom data in Shopware which you can use for your apps. You can store simple data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and objects directly in core tables via [custom fields](custom-fields) or define complete new entities with own associations and lifecycle via [custom entities](custom-entities).
