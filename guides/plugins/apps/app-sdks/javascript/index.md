# JavaScript

The App SDK for JavaScript abstracts and simplifies creating Shopware apps. The SDK uses JavaScript standardized Request/Response objects and therefore is supported to run in Node/Deno/Bun/Cloudflare Workers.

The app SDK provides a context object that grants access to relevant information and services within the Shopware environment. This context is essential for interacting with Shopware's APIs, accessing database entities, and executing various operations.		

To ensure secure communication between the application and Shopware, this SDK supports signing mechanisms, allowing developers to validate the authenticity and integrity of requests and responses.		

It also includes an HTTP client that simplifies making API requests to Shopware endpoints. It provides methods for handling authentication, executing HTTP requests, and processing responses.
