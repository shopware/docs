# Add Custom Icons

## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to use the icon renderer component as well as adding custom icons.

::: info
Even if this is originally a plugin guide, everything will work perfectly in a theme as well. Actually, a theme even is a kind of plugin. So don't get confused by us talking about plugins here.
:::

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide easily, you first need to have a functioning plugin installed. Head over to our [Plugin base guide](../plugins/plugin-base-guide) to create a plugin, if you don't know how it's done yet. Also, knowing and understanding SCSS will be quite mandatory to fully understand what's going on here. Furthermore, it might be helpful to read the guide on how to [handle own assets](../plugins/storefront/add-custom-assets) in your plugin before you start with this one.

## Adding icon

To add any icons to the Storefront, you use our `sw_icon` twig action. This way, an icon of choice is displayed in the Storefront.

Needless to say, the first step is saving your image somewhere in your plugin where Shopware can find it. The default path for icons is the following:

```text
<YourPlugin>/src/Resources/app/storefront/dist/assets/icon/default
`
```

You can also provide "solid" icons or any other custom pack names that can be configured later with the `pack` parameter. You can do that by creating a folder with the pack name:

```text
<YourPlugin>/src/Resources/app/storefront/dist/assets/icon/<pack-name>
```

By default, Shopware looks inside the "default" folder.

```twig
{% sw_icon 'done-outline-24px' style {
    'namespace': 'TestPlugin'
} %}
```

::: info
When you want to see all icons available to the storefront by default, see [here](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/tree/trunk/src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/dist/assets/icon). They are available as `default` and `solid` icon pack.
:::

Imagine you want to use the default `checkmark` icon from the `solid` pack. In this case,

You surely want to add your own custom icons. In this case, the `namespace` parameter is the most important one to configure. In there, you need to set the name of the theme in which the icon is searched for by its name.

::: warning
If you configure no deviating namespace, Shopware will display the Storefront's default icons.
:::

However, these are not all of your possibilities of configuration. As you see, you're able to configure even more things. Let's take a look at the `style` object's possible parameters:

| Configuration | Description | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `size` | Sets the size of the icon | --- |
| `namespace` | Selection of the namespace of the icon, you can compare it with the source of it | Important configuration if you want to use custom icons. |
| `pack` | Selects the pack of different icons | --- |
| `color` | Sets the color of the icon | You can either use pre-defined variants similar to bootstrap (eg: primary , danger etc) or manually style the icon with any color with CSS. |
| `class` | Defines a class of the icon | --- |

A simple but fully functional example could look like below:

```twig
{% sw_extends '@Storefront/storefront/base.html.twig' %}

{% block base_body %}

    {# We want to set our own icon here #}
    <h1>Custom icon:</h1>
    {% sw_icon 'done-outline-24px' style {
        'size': 'lg',
        'namespace': 'TestPlugin',
        'pack': 'solid'
    } %}
    {{ parent() }}

{% endblock %}
```

::: danger
Icons or other custom assets are not included in the theme inheritance.
:::

Inside your theme, you cannot put an icon in a directory corresponding to the core folder structure and expect the core one to be automatically overwritten by it, as you're used to with themes in general.

## Load icons from custom locations

Since Shopware 6.4.1.0 it is possible to define custom locations of your custom icons inside your theme.json file.
You can define the name of the icon pack and the path to those icons under the `iconSets`-key:

```json
{
  /* ... */
  "iconSets": {
    "custom-icons": "app/storefront/src/assets/icon-pack/custom-icons"
  }
}
```

You can use your custom icons by specifying your icon pack:

```twig
{% sw_icon 'done-outline-24px' style {
    'pack': 'custom-icons'
} %}
```

::: warning
This setup is mandatory if you ship your Theme as an App, because otherwise your custom icons can't be loaded.
