# Themes

A Shopware theme is an extension (plugin or app) that enables you to customize and modify the appearance and design of your online storefront. You can change the layout, styling, typography, colors, images, and other visual elements to match your brand identity and desired user experience.

```

Tasks that themes enable include:

* template overrides
* custom styles
* configuration interfaces
* control the order in which styles and templates are loaded

Note that a plugin can also override templates.
