# Themes

Basically a theme can be an app/plugin that aims at changing the visual appearance of the Storefront.

└── App
    └── can include a Theme (Cloud-ready)
```

A Shopware theme plugin/app allows businesses to customize and modify the appearance and design of their online store. It provides the ability to change the layout, styling, and visual elements, such as fonts, colors, and images, to match your brand identity and desired user experience. Businesses can easily manage and apply their custom themes, switch between them, and ensure consistent branding across their store.
