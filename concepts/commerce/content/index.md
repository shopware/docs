Shopware 6 has an integrated content management system based upon layouts which is called *Shopping Experiences*. The tool used to compose and manage layouts is part of the [Admin panel](../../framework/architecture/administration-concept) and referred to as *Page Builder*.

Beyond content management, Shopware also provides [Cookie Consent Management](cookie-consent-management) with features to help support GDPR compliance by handling customer privacy preferences and cookie handling transparently.
