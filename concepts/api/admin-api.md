# Admin API

The Admin API represents the administrative and integration surface of Shopware. It enables structured access to core business entities such as products, orders, customers, media, and configurations. It is intended for backend integrations, automation, data synchronization, and system-to-system communication.

These integrations typically involve structured data exchange, synchronization, imports, exports, and notifications. They prioritize consistency, error handling, validation, and transactional integrity. Performance is also important in terms of high data loads rather than fast response times.

The Admin API provides CRUD operations for every entity within Shopware and is used to build integrations with external systems.

For details on endpoints, authentication methods, schemas, and request formats, always refer to the Admin API documentation.
