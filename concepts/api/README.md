# API

The Shopware API allows developers to interact with and integrate Shopware with other systems and applications. It provides a set of services that enable developers to perform various operations, such as managing products, customers, orders, and shopping carts.The API supports both read and write operations, allowing developers to retrieve information from Shopware and make modifications or additions to the e-commerce platform. By leveraging the Shopware API, developers can extend the functionality of Shopware, integrate it with external systems, and create seamless experiences for managing and operating online stores.

Shopware supports two major functional APIs: the Store API and the Admin API. These APIs serve different purposes. The Store API is designed to interact with the front-end or storefront of a Shopware online store while the Admin API is intended for administrative operations related to managing the back-end of the Shopware platform.

The API documentation provides details on the available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and data structures. It supports different authentication methods, including token-based authentication and OAuth 2.0, to ensure secure communication between the API client and the Shopware platform.
