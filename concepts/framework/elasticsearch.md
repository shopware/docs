# Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a NoSQL Database focused on search capabilities to act as a search engine.
The Shopware implementation of Elasticsearch provides an integrated way to improve the performance of product and category searches.
To use Elasticsearch for your shop, take a look at our [Elasticsearch guide](../../guides/hosting/infrastructure/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-setup)

## Concept

### Enabling Elasticsearch for your search

Elasticsearch is only used in searches that are explicitly defined.
This is by default set to the `ProductSearchRoute`, `ProductListingRoute`, and `ProductSuggestRoute`.
To use Elasticsearch on your own searches, make sure to add the Elasticsearch aware state to your criteria.

::: info
If the Elasticsearch query fails, the data is loaded using MySQL. You can disable this behavior by setting the environment variable `SHOPWARE_ES_THROW_EXCEPTION=1`
:::

```php
$criteria = new \Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\Search\Criteria();
$context = \Shopware\Core\Framework\Context::createDefaultContext();
// Enables Elasticsearch for this search
$context->addState(\Shopware\Core\Framework\Context::STATE_ELASTICSEARCH_AWARE);

$repository->search($criteria, $context);
```

### ElasticsearchDefinition

To provide Elasticsearch for an entity, a corresponding `ElasticsearchDefinition` needs to be added. Shopware has a definition for the product entity called `ProductElasticsearchDefinition`.
This definition defines the fields provided to Elasticsearch and how they are aggregated.

### ElasticsearchEntitySearcher

The `ElasticsearchEntitySearcher` decorates the `EntitySearcher` to map the entity search to the Elasticsearch structure.
The `ElasticsearchEntitySearcher` returns an `IdSearchResult` hydrated by the `ElasticsearchEntitySearchHydrator` as the `EntitySearcher` does, and this result is used to read the found ids from the database.

### ElasticsearchEntityAggregator

The `ElasticsearchEntityAggregator` does the same as the `ElasticsearchEntitySearcher` for aggregations.

### CriteriaParser

The `CriteriaParser` parses the criteria to an Elasticsearch specific notation.

### ProductSearchBuilder

The product search has a special `ProductSearchBuilder` in the core, and so has the Elasticsearch extension, a corresponding extension for the `ProductSearchBuilder`.
This extension matches the queries of the core `ProductSearchBuilder` to the Elasticsearch notation.

### ProductUpdater

The `ProductUpdater` listens to the `ProductIndexerEvent` and triggers the `ElasticsearchIndexer` on changes to a `ProductEntity`.

## Commands

### es:index:cleanup

The command `es:index:cleanup` deletes outdated Elasticsearch indexes.
The parameter `-f` will skip the confirmation.

### es:create:alias

The command `es:create:alias` refreshes the current Elasticsearch index and sets the alias to the index name without the timestamp (which will make this index the active index).
This will happen automatically when a new index is published, so this command can force the alias creation for testing purposes or if something goes wrong.

### es:index

The command `es:index` re-indexes all configured entities to Elasticsearch.

### es:reset

The `es:reset` command resets all active indices with their respective prefix (`SHOPWARE_ES_INDEX_PREFIX`) in the .env file and clears the queue. This command should only be used if an index is corrupted or needs to be set up from scratch. If multiple Shopware instances are accessing the same Elasticsearch Host, you should consider changing the prefix.

### es:status

The command `es:status` returns the status of all current Elasticsearch indices.

### es:test:analyzer

The command `es:test:analyzer` runs an Elasticsearch analyzer on your indices. For more details on Elasticsearch analyzers, take a look at this [external link](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html).

## Customize the Elasticsearch integration

To customize the Elasticsearch integration or add your own fields and entities, refer to the [Elasticsearch extension guide](../../guides/plugins/plugins/elasticsearch/add-product-entity-extension-to-elasticsearch)
