# Migrations

Migrations are PHP classes containing database schema changesets. These changesets can be applied or reverted to bring the database into a certain state. You might know the concept of migrations from other Frameworks or Symfony as well.

## Adding migrations to a plugin

For Shopware to recognize additional plugin migrations, they need to be placed in the `Migration` directory under your plugin's source code root directory.

Each migration filename follows a specific pattern. To ease plugin development, Shopware provides a console command which can be used to generate a correctly named migration file with the default methods needed.

## Modifying the database

Each migration can have two methods. The `update` and `updateDestructive`. The `update` method must contain only non-destructive changes which can be rolled back at any time. The `updateDestructive` method can contain destructive changes, like dropping columns or tables, which cannot be reversed. For examples of database migrations, refer to the below guide:
