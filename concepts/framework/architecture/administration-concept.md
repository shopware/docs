# Administration

In this article, you will get to know the Administration component and learn a lot of its main concepts. Along the way, you  will find answers to the following questions:

* What is the Administration, and what is its main purpose?
* Which technologies are being used?
* How is the Administration structured?
* How is the Administration implemented inside the Platform?
* How is the Administration connected to other components?
* Which parts of the Core are being used?
* What are Modules, Pages, and Components?
* How is the Administration handling Inheritance & ACL?

## Introduction

The Administration component is a Symfony bundle that contains a Single Page Application \(SPA\) written in JavaScript. It conceptually sits on top of the Core - similar to the [Storefront](storefront-concept) component. The SPA itself provides a rich user interface on top of REST-API-based communication. It communicates with the Core component through the Admin API and is an headless application build on custom components written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Similar to the frameworks being used in the Storefront component, the Administration component uses SASS for styling purposes and [Twig.js](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/wiki) to offer templating functionalities. By default, Shopware 6 uses the [Vue I18n plugin](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) in the Administration to deal with translation. Furthermore, [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is being used to bundle and compile the SPA.

## Main concerns

As mentioned previously, the Administration component provides a SPA that communicates with the Core through the [Admin API](../../../concepts/api/admin-api). To summarize, its main concern is to provide a UI for all administrative tasks for a shop owner in Shopware. To be more precise, it does not contain any business logic. Therefore, there is no functional layering but a flat list of modules structured along the Core component and containing Vue.js web components. Every single communication with the Core can, e.g., be inspected throughout the network activities of your browser's developer tools.

Apart from the arguably most central responsibility of creating the UI itself, which can be reached through `/admin`. The Administration components implement a number of cross-cutting concerns. The most important are:

* **Providing inheritance**: As Shopware 6 offers a flexible extension system to develop own apps, plugins, or themes,  one can override or extend the Administration to fit needs. More information can be found in the [inheritance](administration-concept#inheritance) chapter of this article.

* **Data management**: The Administration displays entities of the Core component and handles the management of this data. So, of course, REST-API access is an important concern of [Pages and views](administration-concept#modules-and-their-components) where necessary. You will find many components working with in-memory representations of API-Data.

* **State management**: In contrast to the Core \(Backend\), the Administration is a long-running process contained in the browser. Proper state management is key here. There is a router present handling the current page selection. View and component rendering is done locally in relation to their parents. Therefore, each component manages the state of its subcomponents.

## Structure

The main Vue.js application is wrapped inside a Symfony bundle. You will find the specific SPA sources inside the Administration component in a specific sub-directory of `shopware/src/Administration`. Therefore, the SPA's main entry point is: `./Resources/app/administration`. Everything else inside `shopware/src/Administration` can be seen as a wrapped configuration around the SPA. This bundle's main concern is to set up the initial Routing \(`/admin`\) and the Administration's main template file, which initializes the SPA \(`./Resources/views/administration/index.html.twig`\) and to provide translation handling.

The `src` directory of the SPA below is structured along the three different use cases the Administration faces - provide common functionality, an application skeleton, and modules.

```bash
<shopware/src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/>
|- app
|- core
|- module
```

* `app`: Contains the application basis for the Administration. Generally, you will find framework dependant computational components here.
* `core`: Contains the binding to the Admin API and services.
* `module`: UI and state management of specific view pages, structured along the Core modules. More information on this is detailed below.

## Modules and their components

One module represents a navigation entry in the Administrations main menu. Since the Administration is highly dependent on the Shopware ecommerce Core, the module names reappear in the Administration, though in a slightly different order. The main building block, which the Administration knows, is called `component`, adjacent to web components.

A `component` is the combination of styling, markup, and logic. What a component does will not surprise you if you are already familiar with the [MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). The role of the model and controller collapses into a single class. The components Twig.js template is generally rendered by a JavaScript \(`index.js`\) file and includes styling from an SCSS file. A template file also notifies the JavaScript, which then reacts to specific \(user\) interactions. Furthermore, components can be and often are nested. Our [Component library](https://component-library.shopware.com/) will also give you an overview of our default components.

### General module structure

A `page` represents the entry point or the page that needs to be rendered and encapsulates views. A `view` is a subordinate part of the page that encapsulates components. A `component` can itself encapsulate different components. From this level on, there is no distinction in the directory structure made.

At least one `page` is mandatory in each module. Though views and components can be present in the module, a vast default component library is present to help with default cases.

```bash
|- page1
  |- view1
    |- component1
    |- component2
      |- subcomponent1
      |- …
  |- view2
    |- component3
    |- …
```

### Order module

Having a look at a more practical example, one can look closer at the order module. Typically, you will find this structure alongside other modules, especially when creating pages or views for creating/editing, listing, or viewing a specific entity. Refer to the [Add custom module](../../../guides/plugins/plugins/administration/add-custom-module) article if you want to learn more about adding your custom module with a Shopware plugin.

```bash
<shopware/src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-order/>
|- acl
|- component
  |- sw-order-address-modal
  |- …
|- page
  |- sw-order-create
  |- sw-order-detail
  |- sw-order-list
|- snippet  
|- state  
|- view
  |- sw-order-create-base
  |- sw-order-details-base
|- index.js
```

## Inheritance

To add new functionality or change the behavior of an existing component through plugins, you can either override or extend a component. The difference between the two methods is `Component.extend()` method creates a new component and `Component.override()` method overwrites the previous behavior of the component.

Within plugins, you do have the following options when it comes to adjusting existing components:

* Override a component's logic
* Extend a component's logic
* Customize a component template with Twig.js
* Extending methods and computed properties

You will find more information about [customizing components](../../../guides/plugins/plugins/administration/customizing-components) of the Administration in the guide.

## ACL in the Administration

The Access Control List (ACL) in Shopware ensures that by default, data can only be created, read, updated, or deleted \( CRUD\), once the user has specific privileges for a module. Additionally, one can set up custom roles in the Administrations UI or develop individual privileges with plugins. These roles have finely granular rights, which every shop operator can set up himself and be assigned to users. By default, a module of the Administration has a directory called `acl` included. In this directory, one will find a specific mapping of privileges \(permissions for roles; additional permissions\) for the default roles: `viewer`, `editor`, `creator`, and `deleter`.

For more information, refer to [Adding permissions](../../../guides/plugins/plugins/administration/add-acl-rules) article.
