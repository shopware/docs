# PWA

If you think about providing a decoupled storefront for customers, you can use **Shopware PWA** as a base. It is a Single Page Application (SPA) based on JavaScript and Vue.js that already integrates a whole lot of the Shopware functionality you know into a very extensible frontend application.

[Shopware PWA](https://shopware-pwa-docs.vuestorefront.io/) is based on the [Store API](../concepts/api/store-api).
