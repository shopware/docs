# Configuration

Many configurations can be changed using a `.shopware-extension.yml` file in the root of your extension.

Here is an example of a `.shopware-extension.yml` file:

```yaml
build:
  extraBundles:
    - path: src/Foo
    - name: OverrideName
      path: src/Override
  shopwareVersionConstraint: '~6.6.0'
  zip:
    assets:
      enabled: false
      before_hooks: []
      after_hooks: []
      disable_sass: false
      enable_es_build_for_admin: false
      enable_es_build_for_storefront: false
      npm_strict: false

changelog:
  enabled: true

store:
  automatic_bugfix_version_compatibility: true
  # ...

validation:
  ignore:
    - 'xx'
```

When you edit that file in an editor, you will get autocompletion and hints for the available options.

## Environment variables

Additionally, you can set environment variables to change the behavior of the CLI. The following environment variables are available:
