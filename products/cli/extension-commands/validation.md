# Extension Validation

Shopware CLI has a built-in validation for extensions. This is useful in your CI/CD pipeline to validate the extension before you release it.

## Validating an extension

To validate an extension, you can use the following command:

```bash
shopware-cli extension validate <path>
```

The path can be absolute or relative to the directory containing the extension or the zip file. The command exists with a non-zero exit code if the validation fails with an error level message.

## What is validated?

- The `composer.json` has an `shopware/core` requirement and constraint is parsable
- The extension metadata is filled with:
  - `name`
  - `label` (German and English)
  - `description` (German and English) and longer than 150 characters and shorter than 185 characters
- Translations have equality translated in the given languages
- PHP can be correctly linted with the minimum PHP version
- The `theme.json` can be parsed and included assets can be found

## Supported PHP versions for linting

The following PHP versions are supported for linting:

- 7.3
- 7.4
- 8.1
- 8.2

These versions don't need to be installed locally, they are downloaded on demand and executed using WebAssembly without any dependencies.

## Ignoring errors

Each error has a unique identifier, and they can be individually ignored using the `.shopware-extension.yml`:

```yaml
validation:
  ignore:
    # This is an example key
    - "metadata.setup"
```
