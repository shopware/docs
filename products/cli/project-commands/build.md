# Build a complete Project

Usually, when you want to deploy your project, you have to run `composer install` and compile the assets of the project. Shopware-CLI provides a single command which does all of this for you.

::: warning
This command modifies the given directory and deletes files. Make sure you have committed all your changes before running this command.
:::

```bash
shopware-cli project ci <path>
```

## What it does?

- It runs `composer install` (by default only installs the production dependencies, use `--with-dev-dependencies` to install the dev dependencies as well)
- Looks for missing assets of extensions and only compiles the missing assets to speed up the build process
- Deletes unnecessary files like `node_modules` and many more to save disk space
- Deletes source code of compiled assets to save disk space
- Merges snippets of extensions to speed up Administration

## Using private Composer repositories

If you want to use `packages.shopware.com` as a private Composer repository, make sure you have set `SHOPWARE_PACKAGES_TOKEN` environment variable to your Composer token. This can be found in your Shopware Account.

For other private Composer repositories, you can use the `auth.json` file in the root of your project or set `COMPOSER_AUTH` environment variable with the content of the `auth.json` file.

For more information, see the [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/authentication-for-private-packages.md).

## Reducing JavaScript in Storefront

Shopware's default `browserlist` still supports older browsers like Internet Explorer 11. If you want to reduce JavaScript polyfill and CSS prefixes, you can adjust the `browserlist` configuration in the `.shopware-project.yml` file.

```yaml
build:
  # Browserlist configuration for Storefront
  browserslist: 'defaults'
```

You can check [here which browsers would be affected](https://browsersl.ist/#q=defaults).

## Configuration options

You can configure the build process with a `.shopware-project.yml` file. The following options are available:

```yaml
build:
  # Browserlist configuration for Storefront
  browserslist: 'defaults'
  # Which paths should be deleted
  cleanup_paths:
    - 'node_modules'
  # At the end of the process, bin/console asset:install is executed, this can be disabled here
  disable_asset_copy: false
  # Exclude following extensions from the build process
  exclude_extensions:
    - 'SwagExample'
  # Keep the extension Administration and Storefront source code
  keep_extension_source: false
  # Keep the source maps of the compiled assets
  keep_source_maps: false
  # Delete after bin/console asset:install all assets in the extensions, so only live in public folder.
  # This only works when the assets are served directly from the public folder.
  remove_extension_assets: false 
```

## Supporting bundles

Plugins and Apps are automatically detected by Shopware-CLI. Custom bundles (classes that extend bundle class from Shopware) cannot be automatically detected as Shopware-CLI does not execute any PHP code.
Therefore you need to add the path of the custom bundle to your project `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "shopware-bundles": {
            // The key is the relative path from project root to the bundle
            "src/MyBundle": {}
        }
    }
}
```

If your bundle folder names does not match your bundle name, you can use the `name` key to map the folder to the bundle name.

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "shopware-bundles": {
            "src/MyBundle": {
                "name": "MyFancyBundle"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Bundle packaged in own composer package

If your bundle is a own composer package, make sure your composer type is `shopware-bundle` and that you have set a `shopware-bundle-name` in the extra part of the config like this:

```json
{
    "name": "my-vendor/my-bundle",
    "type": "shopware-bundle",
    "extra": {
        "shopware-bundle-name": "MyBundle"
    }
}
```

With this Composer type, `shopware-cli extension build` also works for your bundle, if you want to distribute compiled assets.

## Example Docker Image

This is an example Dockerfile which builds a Shopware project and copies the source code to the `/var/www/html` folder.

```dockerfile
#syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4

# pin versions
FROM shopware/docker-base:8.3 AS base-image
FROM shopware/shopware-cli:latest-php-8.3 AS shopware-cli

# build

FROM shopware-cli AS build

ARG SHOPWARE_PACKAGES_TOKEN

ADD . /src
WORKDIR /src

RUN --mount=type=secret,id=composer_auth,dst=/src/auth.json \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.composer \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh shopware-cli project ci /src

FROM base-image

COPY --from=build --chown=82 --link /src /var/www/html
```

Besides Docker, it is also a perfect fit for any deployment variant.
