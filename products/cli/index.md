# Shopware-CLI

Shopware-CLI is an open-source external command-line interface for Shopware 6. It provides a set of commands to interact with your Shopware instance, build extensions, dump databases, and more. The CLI **is an extra tool** and needs to be set up separately from your Shopware instance.

The CLI consists of three command scopes:

- Project commands: Commands to interact with your Shopware project
- Extension commands: Commands to build Shopware extensions
- Store commands: Commands to publish extensions to the Shopware Store or update

If you want to use the CLI, you need to [install it first](installation.md) or take a look at each area of the CLI.
