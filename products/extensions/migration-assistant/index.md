# Migration Assistant

To either migrate data (products, customers, etc.) from the existing shop system to Shopware 6 or to update them, you need to establish a connection between a data source (existing shop, e.g., Shopware 5) and Shopware 6. The Migration Assistant makes it possible to connect these two systems. Once the connection is established, it can be accessed at any time. After the first complete migration, individual datasets can also be migrated or updated as needed.

Let's learn more about this extension in the following sections.
