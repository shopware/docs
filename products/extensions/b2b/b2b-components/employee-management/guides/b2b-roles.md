# B2B Roles

Roles can be used to bind multiple permission to employees with contexts. Every employee can have one assigned role. Based on that role and the containing permission, the employee will get access to certain information and functionalities.

The business partner has the opportunity to create a “default” role that will be selected by default, when creating a new employee.
