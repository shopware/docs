# B2B Extension

Unlike the B2B Suite, the B2B Components aim to provide a flexible set of B2B-related features. This enables B2B merchants to deliver the experience they want to their business partners. This is achieved by providing abilities that allow B2B Merchants to conduct basic B2B jobs and enable agencies to extend the Components according to the merchant's specific requirements.
