# Subscriptions

To enable flexibility in product offerings, the subscription extension aims to provide a subscription-based model for products.
This extension allows you to offer products on a subscription basis.
The subscription model is a recurring payment model where customers can subscribe to a product and receive it at regular intervals.
This model is beneficial for products that are consumed regularly, such as groceries, cosmetics, or magazines.

We suggest that you first familiarize yourself with the [subscription concepts](./concept.md) as well as the [user documentation](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/settings/shop/subscriptions) before you start using the extension.
