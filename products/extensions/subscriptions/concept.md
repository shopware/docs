# Concepts

To use subscriptions, you will need to be familiar with two core concepts in subscription models.

## Plans

A plan is a set of rules that define the subscription. This includes the price, the billing interval, and the product that the customer will receive. Plans can be created and managed in the Shopware administration.

## Intervals

An interval is the time between each billing cycle. For example, a subscription can be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually. The interval is defined in the plan and can be set to any time frame.
