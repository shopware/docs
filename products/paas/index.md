# Introduction to PaaS

While both [Shopware PaaS Native](./shopware) and [Shopware PaaS](./shopware-paas) offer cloud-based environments for development, they differ in specialization and flexibility:

- **Shopware PaaS**: A generic PaaS provider, [Shopware PaaS](./shopware-paas) supports various applications and multiple cloud providers, giving developers the flexibility to define their infrastructure as code. However, this requires customers to manage more aspects of infrastructure and setup.

- **Shopware PaaS Native**: Optimized solely for Shopware, this platform provides a tightly integrated and controlled environment on AWS. This focus ensures higher stability, with Shopware managing all underlying configurations, enabling developers to concentrate on application development.

By using [Shopware PaaS Native](./shopware), teams benefit from a unified, robust platform that simplifies the development lifecycle, enhances performance, and enables faster innovation.
