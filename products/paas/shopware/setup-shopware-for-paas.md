# Shopware Setup for PaaS

## Prerequisite

**macOS** and **Linux** are the recommended environments for local development. On **Windows**, it's advisable to use [Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XYFRDlT9WI) or **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for a consistent development experience.

To develop and customize your Shopware project effectively, certain operations must be performed in a local environment. This is especially important for tasks that directly interact with the file system, such as Installing or upgrading plugins, adjusting system-level configuration (e.g., language, environment) or applying custom code changes.

Plugin management via the Shopware Administration interface is **not supported**. This is because the platform operates in a **high-availability (HA), clustered setup**, where all application instances must remain **stateless and identical**.

To ensure consistency and reproducibility across deployments, plugins must be installed or updated **via Composer** as part of the projectâ€™s codebase. Follow the official guidance on [managing extensions with Composer](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/hosting/installation-updates/extension-managment.html#installing-extensions-with-composer).

Additionally, before installation, verify that each plugin supports **S3-based storage**, as not all extensions are compatible with external file systems.

## Prepare Your Shopware Application

Whether you're starting from scratch or working with an existing Shopware project, the following steps will ensure your setup is ready for deployment on Shopware PaaS.

### For New Projects

To create a new Shopware project from the official production template, run:

```sh
composer create-project shopware/production <folder-name>
```

Then navigate into the project directory and proceed with the next steps.

### For Existing Projects

If you're working with an already created Shopware project, simply navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd <your-project-folder>
```

Ensure the required Kubernetes metadata package is installed to enable compatibility with the [Shopware Operator](https://github.com/shopware/shopware-operator):

```sh
composer require shopware/k8s-meta --ignore-platform-reqs
```

:::info
The `--ignore-platform-reqs` flag ensures that all necessary recipes are installed, even if your local PHP version differs from the required platform version.
:::

This package installs essential configuration files, including those required for deploying your shop via the Shopware Operator. After installation, verify that the file `config/packages/operator.yaml` has been created.

### Create the `application.yaml` File

At the root of your project, create a file named `application.yaml`. This file defines key deployment parameters, such as the PHP version and any environment-specific configuration needed for your shop.

#### Basic Example

```yaml
app:
  php:
    version: "8.3"
  environment_variables: []
  hooks: {}
services:
  mysql:
    version: "8.0"
```

#### Advanced Example (with Custom Environment Variables)

```yaml
app:
  php:
    version: "8.3"
  environment_variables:
    - name: INSTALL_LOCALE
      value: fr-FR
      scope: RUN # Supports RUN or BUILD
  hooks: {}
services:
  mysql:
    version: "8.0"
```
