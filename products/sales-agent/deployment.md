## Deployment

For general information about running a Nuxt application in production, refer to the [official docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment).

In addition, you still need to setup the Database and cache layer for production mode.

## Nuxt production build

To build and start the project in production mode:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
