# Client and Server Routing

Refer to the Nuxt documentation for more information about how [server](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server) and [client](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages) routes work internally.

For an up-to-date overview of all routes for this application, you can use the [Nuxt dev tools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/). This should be enabled by default during local development.
