# Frontend App Deployment

According to [Shopware Frontends deployment document](https://frontends.shopware.com/best-practices/deployment.html), all the templates which were generated by Shopware Frontends can be deployed in multiple ways, depending on the setup you are using. Most likely you will be using either a static hosting service or a server with a Node.js runtime.

You may find the different approaches as described in [Nuxt instruction](https://nuxt.com/deploy).

Alternatively, we will show some best practices of *Sales Agent* frontend app deployment.
