### Local SSL setup

To set up SSL for local development, follow the below steps:

1. Install `mkcert` (or similar tools)
2. Inside the SalesAgent directory, run `mkcert localhost`. This will generate a key pair in your current directory.
3. Run `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 nuxt dev --host=localhost --https --ssl-cert 'localhost.pem' --ssl-key 'localhost-key.pem'`

:::info
You can also replace localhost with any IP address or domain name, for example, if you want to test this application from different devices over your local network.
