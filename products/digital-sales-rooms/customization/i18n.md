# I18n Customization

This guide will walk you through the process of customizing the internationalization (i18n) setup in your Nuxt 3 project using the Nuxt layer concept. By using this method, you can extend and override the default i18n functionality to meet your specific requirements without modifying the core files.

## Configure i18n

Configure the i18n settings in your `nuxt.config.ts` file. This configuration defines the language directory and any specific language configurations you want to override.

Add the following configuration to `nuxt.config.ts`:

```js
modules: [
  "@nuxtjs/i18n",
],
i18n: {
  langDir: "./i18n/src/langs/",
  ...i18nConfig,
},
```

## Create the i18n Folder in the custom layer

To customize the i18n functionality, we need to create a new folder structure in your custom layer. You will mirror the default layer's structure, but only create the files you need to override.

Take a look on `example` layer to understand the structure.
