# Digital Sales Rooms with SaaS

If you are a Beyond merchant and are using SaaS, the *Digital Sales Rooms* plugin is installed in your SaaS instance. So, you should see the *Digital Sales Rooms* section in the Marketing menu item.
However, there are some steps that need to be completed to ensure the DSR functions fully with SaaS:

- [Deploy the frontend app](../app-deployment/index.md)

- [3rd parties](../../setup-3rd-party/index.md)

- [Configuration](../../configuration/index.md)
