# Accessibility in the Storefront

At Shopware, we are committed to creating inclusive and barrier-free shopping experiences for our merchants and their customers.

## What shopware does to ensure accessibility

* Shopware is committed to fulfill the [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) accessibility guidelines and Barrier-Free Information Technology Regulation (BITV 2.0) in the Storefront. 
    * You can find more information on [shopware.design](https://shopware.design/foundations/accessibility.html) and [in our blog post](https://www.shopware.com/en/news/accessible-online-store-by-2025/).
* The Storefront is using [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/accessibility/) that already consider good accessibility practices, for example, using aria roles.
* Much of the HTML structure and CSS styling already fulfill accessibility guidelines. However, there are still [open accessibility issues](#Overview-of-known-accessibility-issues) that will be addressed. 
* Automated [E2E testing with playwright](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/tree/trunk/tests/acceptance) and axe reporter are used to ensure future accessibility.

## How core accessibility improvements are released

Accessibility improvements are rolled out in regular minor releases, similar to other improvements or bug-fixes. We implement all accessibility improvements in the current major version `6.6.x` and its minor versions.
There is no large "accessibility release" planned that ships all accessibility improvements at once. 

## How to deal with breaking accessibility changes

Ensuring an accessible shop page can require changes in the HTML/Twig structure or the CSS. This can cause unintended behavior for an extension that is modifying an area that is being changed to improve accessibility.

Because of this, breaking accessibility changes are not enabled by default. All accessibility changes that include breaking changes are implemented behind a feature flag: 

```env
ACCESSIBILITY_TWEAKS
```

However, breaking accessibility changes are still released regularly inside minor releases. They are just not active by default to not cause a breaking change.

The feature flag `ACCESSIBILITY_TWEAKS` can be activated inside your `.env`, similar to the major feature flags like `V6_7_0_0`. When the feature flag is enabled, all available accessibility improvements are activated.
This allows you to check if your project or extension is effected by the change and already prepare an adaptation to the change if it is necessary.

::: warning
With the major version v6.7.0 all accessibility improvements will become the default.
:::

### Example of a breaking accessibility change

Let's say, for example, that a list is not using a proper markup, and it is changed to improve accessibility.

This is what a suboptimal HTML structure could look like:
```twig
<div class="sidebar-list">
    {% block component_list_items %}
        <div class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></div>
        <div class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></div>
        <div class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></div>
    {% endblock %}
</div>
```

Let's assume it should be changed to a proper list. Instead of implementing this right away, it is implemented behind the `ACCESSIBILITY_TWEAKS` flag, including instructions how it should be changed:
```twig
{# @deprecated tag:v6.7.0 - The list will be changed to `<ul>` and `<li>` to improve accessibility #}
{% if feature('ACCESSIBILITY_TWEAKS') %}
    <ul class="sidebar-list">
        {% block component_list_items_inner %}
            <li class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></li>
            <li class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></li>
            <li class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></li>
        {% endblock %}
    </ul>
{% else %}
    <div class="sidebar-list">
        {# @deprecated tag:v6.7.0 - Use `component_list_items_inner` instead with `<li>` #}
        {% block component_list_items %}
            <div class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></div>
            <div class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></div>
            <div class="list-item"><a href="#">Item</a></div>
        {% endblock %}
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

If the block `component_list_items` is being extended, the new accessibility change can already be considered. If the change was rolled out without a feature flag, the extension still assumes a `<div class="list-item">` which would likely result in incorrect HTML:
```twig
{% sw_extends '@Storefront/storefront/component/list.html.twig' %}

{# Consider the new structure already #}
{% block component_list_items_inner %}
    {{ parent() }}
    <li class="list-item"><a href="#">My item</a></li>
{% endblock %}

{# This can be removed after v6.7.0 #}
{% block component_list_items %}
    {{ parent() }}
    <div class="list-item"><a href="#">My item</a></div>
{% endblock %}
```
