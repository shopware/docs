# Storefront Controller

## Controller

* Each controller action requires a `#Route` attribute.
* The name of the route should start with "frontend".
* Each route should define the corresponding HTTP Method \(GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH\).
* The function name should be concise.
* Each function should define a return type hint.
* A route should have a single purpose.
* Use Symfony flash bags for error reporting.
* Each storefront functionality has to be available inside the Store API too.
* A Storefront controller should never contain business logic.
* The class requires the attribute: `#[Route(defaults: ['_routeScope' => ['storefront']])]`.
* Depending services have to be injected over the class constructor.
* Depending services have to be defined in the DI-Container service definition.
* Depending services have to be assigned to a private class property.
* A Storefront controller has to extend the `\Shopware\Storefront\Controller\StorefrontController`.

## Read operations inside Storefront controllers

* A Storefront controller should never use a repository directly. The data should be fetched over a route or page loader.
* Routes that load a full Storefront page should use a page loader class to load all corresponding data.
* Pages that contain data that are the same for all customers should have the `_httpCache` attribute.

## Write operations inside Storefront controllers

* Write operations should create their response with the `createActionResponse` function to allow different forwards and redirects.
* Each write operation has to call a corresponding Store API route.
