# Backward Compatibility

## Introduction

Shopware is a standard ecommerce solution used by many customers worldwide and is the technical foundation of their online business. As developers of Shopware, it is our highest goal to guarantee the reliability of the software for our customers. Always remember that every change you make can have a big impact on the life of our customers, either in a good way or in a bad way.

For the release strategy, Shopware uses a semantic [versioning](https://www.shopware.com/en/news/shopware-6-versioning-strategy/) and therefore has to be always backward compatible for minor and patch updates. This brings additional challenges when changing the code of Shopware. The following guide aims to provide you with the necessary workflows and techniques to do your changes in a backward compatible way and what to do if it is not possible.

## Annotations

During the development, different cases occur where you want to replace old code with new ones or even remove some obsolete code. As Shopware must always be backward compatible on minor and patch updates, old code should only be removed with a major release. Until the next major release, you want to mark the code with a corresponding annotation to inform other developers of the planned change. This overview shows the most important annotations and in which situation they must be used.

### @deprecated

```php
/**
 * @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Use NewFunction() instead
 */
```

The `@deprecated` annotation is used for obsolete public code, which will be removed with the next major release. The annotation always needs the specific major version tag, in which the code should be removed. Always add a meaningful comment with information about the corresponding replacement and how the deprecated code can be removed.

### @feature-deprecated

```php
/**
 * @feature-deprecated (flag:FEATURE_NEXT_11111)
 */
```

The `@feature-deprecated` annotation is used for obsolete code during the development of a feature when the code is still hidden behind a feature flag. This is important so that code that is not public will not trigger deprecation warnings. This annotation has to be changed to the correct `@deprecated` annotation when the feature is released, and the corresponding feature flag is removed. Always add the name of the corresponding feature flag to the annotation so that it will not be forgotten when the flag is removed.

### @major-deprecated

```php
/**
 * @major-deprecated (flag:FEATURE_NEXT_22222)
 */
```

The `@major-deprecated` annotation is used for breaking code which has to stay behind a specific major feature flag until the next major release. Always add the name of the corresponding feature flag to the annotation so that it will not be forgotten when the flag is removed.

### @internal

```php
/**
 * @internal (flag:FEATURE_NEXT_11111)
 */
```

In combination with a feature flag, like shown above, the `@internal` annotation is used for newly introduced code, which is not yet released. This ensures that it will not be treated as a public API until the corresponding feature is released and makes it possible to change the code in any way until the final release. Always add the name of the corresponding feature flag to the annotation so that it will not be forgotten when the corresponding feature is released.

## Workflows

### Backward compatible features

When developing new features, the goal should always be to do this in a backward compatible way. This ensures that the feature can be shipped with a minor release to provide value for customers as soon as possible. The following table should help you to use the correct approach for each type of change.

### Breaking Changes / Features

The first goal should always be to make your changes backward compatible. But there might be some special cases where it isn't possible in any way. In this case, the change can only be released with a major version. As we develop all changes in the same code base, the `trunk` branch, the changes have to stay behind a special feature flag, which is especially marked as a major feature flag.

## Compatibility sheet

To ensure backward compatibility, it is important to know what you are allowed to do and what not. The following sheet should give you an orientation on common changes and how they could affect the backward compatibility. Although a lot of effort went into this list, it is not guaranteed to be 100% complete. Always keep the persona of third-party developers in mind and challenge your changes against external needs.

### PHP

As Shopware is based on the PHP framework Symfony, we also have to make sure to use the rules which the framework follows. Besides the list below, always keep in mind the backward compatibility promise and implement your changes in a way the promise is kept.

## Code Examples

### PHP

#### Extend class with abstract class

```php
/** Before */
class MailService implements MailServiceInterface
 
/** After */
class MailService extends AbstractMailService
class AbstractMailService implements MailServiceInterface
```

#### Add an argument

```php
/**
 * @feature-deprecated tag:v6.5.0 (flag:FEATURE_NEXT_22222)
 * Parameter $precision will be mandatory in future implementation
 */
public function calculate(ProductEntity $product, Context $context /*, int $precision */): Product
{
   if (Feature::isActive('FEATURE_NEXT_22222')) {
      if (\func_num_args() === 3) {
         $precision = func_get_arg(2);
         // Do new calculation
      } else {
         throw new InvalidArgumentException('Argument 3 $precision is required with feature FEATURE_NEXT_22222');
      }
   } else {
      // Do old calculation
   }
}
```

#### Add a public function

```php
/** Before */
abstract class AbstractProductRoute
{
    abstract public function getDecorated(): AbstractProductRoute;
 
    abstract public function load();
}
 
 
/** After */
abstract class AbstractProductRoute
{
    abstract public function getDecorated(): AbstractProductRoute;
 
    abstract public function load();
 
    /**
     * @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Will be abstract 
     */
    public function loadV2()
    {
        return $this->getDecorated()->loadV2();
    }
}
```

### TWIG & HTML

#### Deprecate TWIG block

**Storefront**: Use the `deprecated` tag from TWIG, including a comment with the normal annotation.

```html
{% block the_block_name %}
    {% deprecated '@deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Block will be removed completely including the content' %}
    <div>Content</div>
{% endblock %}
```

**Administration**: Use normal TWIG comments for the annotation, as the other syntax is not supported.

```html
{% block the_block_name %}
    {# @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Block will be removed completely including the content #}
    <div>Content</div>
{% endblock %}
```

#### Rename TWIG block

```html
{% block new_block_name %}
    {% block old_block_name %}
    {% deprecated '@deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Use `new_block_name` instead' %}
        <div>Content</div>
    {% endblock %}
{% endblock %}
```

#### Deprecate CSS selectors

```html
{# @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - CSS class "card-primary" is deprecated, use "card-major" instead #}
<div class="card card-major card-primary">
    ...
</div>
```

#### Deprecate Vue Slot

```html
{# @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Use slot "main-content" instead #}
<slot name="content"></slot>
<slot name="main-content"></slot>
```

### JavaScript

#### Add new public function

```javascript
// route.service.js
export default class RouteService {
    /**
     * @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Use getRouteConfig() instead
     */
    getRoute(symfonyRoute) {
        // Returns string 'foo/bar'
        return this._someMagic(symfonyRoute);
    }
 
    getRouteConfig() {
        // Returns object { name: 'foo/bar', params: [] }
        return {
            url: this._someMagic(symfonyRoute).url,
            params: this._someMagic(symfonyRoute).params
        }
    }
}
```

#### Rename a method

```javascript
/**
 * @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Use onItemClick() instead
 */
onClick(event) {
    return onItemClick(event);
},
 
onItemClick(event) {
    // ...
}
```

#### Deprecate admin components

```javascript
/**
 * @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Use sw-new instead
 * @status deprecated
 */
Shopware.Component.register('sw-old', {
    deprecated: '6.5.0'
});
```

#### Deprecate admin component properties

```json
{
    name: 'example-component',
    props: {
        /** @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Insert additional information in comments */
        exampleProp: {
            type: String,
            required: false,
            default: 'Default value',
            deprecated: {
                version: '6.5.0',
                comment: 'Insert additional information in comments'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Adding required properties to components

```json
{
    createdComponent() {
        /** @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Warning will be removed when prop is required */
        if (!this.newProp) {
            debug.warn(
                'sw-example-component',
                '"newProp" will be required in tag:v6.5.0'
            );
        }
    }
}
```

#### Renaming or removing JS services

```javascript
// http-client.service.js
/**
* @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Use NewHttpClient instead (new-http-client.service.js)
*/
export default class HttpClient {
    // ...
}
 
// new-http-client.service.js
export default class NewHttpClient {
    // ...
}
```

#### Renaming or removing JS plugins

```javascript
// buy-button.plugin.js
/**
* @deprecated tag:v6.5.0 - Use NewBuyButtonPlugin instead (new-buy-button.plugin.js)
*/
export default class BuyButtonPlugin extends Plugin {
    // ...
}
 
// new-buy-button.plugin.js
export default class NewBuyButtonPlugin extends Plugin {
    // ...
}
```
