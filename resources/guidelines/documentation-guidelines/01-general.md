## Use of third-party sources

Third-party sources include websites, books, blogs, videos, images, and more. Ensure to reference these external sources in the documentation only if they are trustworthy. Avoid copying any content directly from other sources like websites, encyclopedias, and Wikipedia.

## Markdown rules

Adhere to the [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) while creating the document.

Refer to [Vitepress syntax](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown) for features like hint block, emoji, API blocks, etc.

Symbols in Markdown sometimes serve multi-purpose. For example, `*` or `-` can be used to create bulleted lists. However, follow a single pattern to maintain uniformity throughout. Further sections describe the usage of these patterns and let us comply with them.

Also, user-defined rules govern the content quality, such as removing trailing spaces, code fence style, and more. You may refer to these rules in the [Markdown style of Shopware docs](https://github.com/shopware/docs/blob/master/markdown-style-config.yml).

The following section details the conceptual outline structure of our documentation.
