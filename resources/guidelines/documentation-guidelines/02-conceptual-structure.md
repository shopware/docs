# Conceptual Outline

Our documentation is categorized into the following sections - Concepts, Products, Guides, and Resources. This structure provides different levels of detail, abstraction, and focus.

To give our readers a good experience, we have established writing guidelines for these sections.

## Concepts

This section articulates the core concepts of Shopware. It is an entry point to learn about how the platform is organized. This section rather **explains** than **shows** how things work

## Products

This section deals with topics specific to a single product of Shopware. Every product shares at least some aspect and serves as an entry point to other sections. For example, the *catalog* used within our Community Edition and in all commercial plans is technically the same.

## Guides

This section of the document is home to all the *how-to's*, *examples, cookbooks*, and *tutorials*. In contrast to articles within the *Concepts section*, *Guides* show code, give concrete examples, and provide step-by-step instructions.

It is essential to refer back to the concepts section for related topics from the Guides. For example, *"How to create a custom cart processor"* might contain terms and concepts explained within the "Concepts &gt; Commerce &gt; Checkout &gt; Cart" section and also relate to topics dealt within the "Concepts &gt; Framework &gt; Rules" section. A clear structure allows you to create these cross-references and make the documentation more readable.

## Resources

Resources contain structured documentation for API references, code references, testing references, tooling, links, SDKs, libraries, etc. It also includes guidelines for contribution and publishing.

Now that you have understood the documentation structure, the following section describes the command over language one needs to use for documentation.
